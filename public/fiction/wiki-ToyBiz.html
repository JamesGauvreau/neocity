                    Trade 2003), was a 2003 decision in the United States Court of International Trade which determined
                    that for purposes of tariffs, some of Toy Biz's action figures that represented well-known members
                    of the X-Men and other superhumans were toys, not dolls, because mutants were “nonhuman creatures.”
                    This decision effectively halved the tariff rate from 12 percent tax to 6.8 percent, and also
                    influenced the course of mutant rights activism. </span>

                    <p>Customs duties for goods imported to the United States were determined by the Tariff Schedules of
                        the
                        United States (TSUS) until 1989, when this document was replaced by the Harmonized Tariff
                        Schedules
                        of the United States (HTSUS). Under the HTSUS there was a distinction between two types of
                        action
                        figures: &ldquo;dolls representing only human beings,&rdquo;[] and &ldquo;toys representing
                        animals
                        or non-human creatures (for example, robots and monsters).&rdquo;[]</p>
                    <p>When <em>Toy Biz v. United States </em>reached Judge Barzilay in 2003, nonhumans and even
                        part-humans
                        of various kinds (half-humans, ex-humans, etc.) had less than complete personhood under U.S.

                        demonic incursions, and similar emergencies (especially from 1939 on), the state of New York was
                        especially severe on this topic. For example, ghosts were unable to give testimony in a New York
                        court until 2004[a] and could be subjected to no-notice exorvictions until 2010. From 1966 to
                        2003,
                        the &ldquo;unjustified killing&rdquo; of a nonhuman extraterrestrial was considered a
                        misdemeanor
                        under Executive Order No. 38, which also gave defendants considerable latitude with which to
                        justify
                        their actions.[b]</p>

                </div>
<div class="leftbody">
    <p>In order to recoup duties paid to the Customs Service, Toy Biz sought to establish that various plastic figures imported from Symkaria in the mid-1990s were toys rather than dolls. By the time that <em>Toy Biz v. United States</em> reached Judge Barzilay, the case had passed three times by the bench of Judge Delissa Ridgway, where <em>Toy Biz v. United States </em>was designated as a test case in order to establish a precedent for similar tariff disputes. Initially, there were four types of product in dispute: (1) figurines which either were made or appeared to be made of metal, (2) figurines that operated as both action figures and small slide projectors, (3) other action figures, all of which depicted mutants, and (4) a 10.5-inch figurine called &ldquo;Jumpsie&rdquo; and various accessories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ridgway&rsquo;s first opinion, issued in 2000, primarily established that a quick summary judgment was impossible due to a disagreement on crucial facts of the matter, such as whether certain figurines depicted humans. The Customs Office argued that &ldquo;doll&rdquo; had been defined broadly in the past and that &ldquo;courts have recognized that dolls need not include all the anatomical elements of a real person.&rdquo; Toy Biz did not dispute these precedents but believed that they had been rendered obsolete by the new rules of the HTSUS, under which any degree of non-humanity meant that a figurine was not human, even if such a &ldquo;hybrid figure&rdquo; was <em>mostly</em> human.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2001, the deliberations mostly concerned a line of metal figurines called the &ldquo;Steel Mutants&rdquo; and plastic figurines which represented persons who were made of metal or wore metal armor, such as Iron Man. Toy Biz described these as modern-day variants of &ldquo;tin soldiers and the like,&rdquo; which would permit them to classify the figurines as toys regardless of whether they represented human beings. Ridgway ruled against them, referring to the case of <em>Hasbro Indus., Inc. v. United States (1989)</em>, which classified G. I. Joe figurines as dolls because the characters they represented each had &ldquo;a distinctive physical appearance and personality profile,&rdquo; were generally played with in small groups rather than in the mass, anonymous quantities of a tin soldier army, and were poseable and manipulable where the archetypal tin soldier was a stiff, molded figurine without moving parts. Although Toy Biz felt that <em>Hasbro v. United States </em>should be ignored because it was decided under the TSUS rather than HTSUS, Ridgway found that on this matter there was no substantive difference between the HTSUS and its predecessor, making <em>Hasbro v. United States</em> a legitimate and useful precedent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ridgway&rsquo;s third and final opinion, issued in 2002, chiefly concerned the &ldquo;Projector&rdquo; figurines, described as &ldquo;colorful, poseable seven-and-one-half-inch plastic figures, with miniature slide projectors in their cavities.&rdquo; Toy Biz argued that, setting aside whether figurines which depicted mutants also and at the same time depicted humans, the Projectors should be classified as &ldquo;other toys&rdquo; or as &ldquo;toy sets&rdquo; because each contained a non-toy component (the slide projector) and was packaged with three film disks. The Customs Office determined that each Projector was a &ldquo;composite figurine&rdquo; composed of a figurine (to be considered a doll) and its projector, plus accessories (the film disks), and Toy Biz responded that the Projectors were &ldquo;more than&rdquo; dolls and therefore non-dolls (reminiscent of their later, more widely-known argument that mutants, being &ldquo;more than&rdquo; humans, were non-human).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customs also maintained that, seeing as dolls could contain mechanisms that moved, produced a voice, or operated in other ways, and seeing as some of the film disks portrayed speech bubbles, the slide projector was a mechanism for producing (a kind of) speech and therefore (a kind of) voice. Ridgway disagreed, pointing out that the slide projectors visually portrayed speech but did not actually produce sound, and also held that &ldquo;it is apparent that the &lsquo;other mechanisms&rsquo; referred to in the Explanatory Notes [of the HTSUS] were mechanisms that contribute to a figure&rsquo;s lifelike simulation,&rdquo; and the Projectors did not so contribute because &ldquo;humans do not project film images from their chest.&rdquo; Therefore, they were &ldquo;composite figures&rdquo; whose nature was ultimately to be decided according to their &ldquo;essential character&rdquo; as either human or non-human beings, but Ridgway determined that &ldquo;additional evidence and arguments [were] needed to decide this issue.&rdquo;</p>
