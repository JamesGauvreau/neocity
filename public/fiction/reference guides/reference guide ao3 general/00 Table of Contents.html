    <h1>Navigating AO3</h1>
    <p><b>X. Comfy-fy Your Reading Experience</b></p>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Archive Warnings:</b> What they mean, and what a story does or doesn't have to tag for.</li>

        <li><b>Comfy-fy Your Reading Experience:</b> How the Archive Warning system works. How to use tags to find fics
            that you want to read, and avoid fics that you don't. How to use site skins and Tampermonkey to block tags
            and authors, and emphasize tags and other things that you care about.</li>
        <li><b>Please Read and Review:</b> Advice and support for commenting on other people's works, including
            suggestions on what to say, tools to help you say it, and lots and lots of affirmation that the author
            really does want to hear from you.
    </ul>
    <p><b>X. Reading Works</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>What the Buttons Mean:</b> Downloading fics, what happens when you download them, and how to use Calibre.</li>
        <li><b>Bookmarks:</b> Difference between private and public bookmarks. What recs are.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>X. Fannish Norms and Etiquette</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Not sure how this one will be organized, but will probably re-mention any norms, et cetera mentioned
            elsewhere: please comment! don't like, don't read! and so on. I'm not sure where this should actually fall
            in the order of chapters; feels like it should be either the first or the last, at least in the reading
            section.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h1>Writing</h1>
    <p><b>X. General Tips</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>On Chapter Length:</b> In short, “Don't be too long.”</li>
        <li><b>On Foreshadowing:</b> Especially important in fandoms where fanon and disagreements of
            interpretation of canon are common, and your reader may therefore have a very different understanding than
            you of what is possible.</li>
        <li><b>On Writing Descriptions:</b> My personal techniques for writing visual descriptions (which may be helpful
            for
            aphantasic writers in particular), considering point-of-view when you decide what and how to describe, and
            avoiding overly-generic words like “it” when you can be specific.</li>
    </ul>
