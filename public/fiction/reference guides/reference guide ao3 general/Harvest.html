    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <p><a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Recursive_Fanfiction" rel="nofollow"> Recursive fanfiction</a>, or fanfiction
        of other people's fanfiction, can be controversial. Some people don't believe that you should write it without
        permission, and some people think you shouldn't write it at all. I think that this is bullshit. I will usually
        ask permission before I write recursive fanfiction, but I view this as an issue of politeness rather than
        morality, and I rarely ask permission to use an element of someone's story in my own (e.g. characters,
        worldbuilding). What I do think is genuinely important is <em> giving credit</em>.</p>

    <p>Things that I recommend adding to your profile:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Blanket_Statement" rel="nofollow">Blanket statement</a> giving permission
            for derivative works based on your own fan works.</li>
        <li>Some information about yourself and how you fit into fandom: how did you get into this, what have you done
            here, and maybe some other stuff. Betts has written about <a
                href="https://bettsfic.tumblr.com/post/184971117987/socknography-the-importance-of-preserving-fan"
                rel="nofollow">the importance of fan author biographies</a> and has suggestions for other things to
            include if you're willing to get more detailed. As a historian of Harry Potter fandom, I can't stress enough
            how plausible it is that somebody might track down your fic and have some questions about its author, twenty
            years after you wrote it.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Formatting</h3>

    <p>Fanfiction.net is a dying nightmarescape held together by duct tape and Faustian bargains, whose founder
        disappeared years ago when the Devil came to collect his due for reasons that are a mystery to us all. I will
        speak of it no further except to say that, if that site is dying, then Ficwad is undead. Furthermore, I know
        nothing of Wattpad or whatever else the kids are posting on today.</p>

    <p>All of this is to say that my formatting advice is exclusively for posting on Archive of Our Own. If there are
        other guides for other websites, then I may add them to this list if you let me know of them.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Fanwork%20Research%20*a*%20Reference%20Guides" rel="nofollow">
            Fanwork Research &amp; Reference Guides </a> tag is a useful tag in general, which I recommend that you
        check if you're writing a crossover.</p>

    <h3>Posting</h3>

    <p>If it's been more than a couple of weeks since your last update, then consider including a short recap in the
        chapter summary or opening notes. If it's been more than a month since your last update, then definitely include
        a short recap.</p>

    <p>If you think that it would be a good idea to make a content warning but you don't want to spoil things for people
        who don't want to be told about anything, then you can give the content warning in the chapter's end notes, and
        mention the presence of the content warning in the chapter's beginning notes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>"<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3221720" rel="nofollow">Dates Matter: or why do I care when your
                work was first published</a>," by snowgall, is about the importance of accurate publishing dates:
            they're useful not just for fannish historians like myself but for readers, whose expectations will often be
            shaped by the publication date (e.g. pre-2007 stories have no chance of being DH-compliant).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tagging Guide</h3>

    <p>Tags are great, but so is chocolate, and you wouldn't want to eat so much chocolate that you vomit, or mainline
        some into your arteries. Like chocolate, it's possible to have too many tags or to use them in the wrong way.
    </p>
    <h4>General Guidelines</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>If it's important to the story, then tag it!</li>
        <li>Consider your cast, and drop each of them into three piles: main characters, supporting characters, and
            background characters. Definitely tag your main characters, sometimes tag one or more supporting characters,
            and never tag your background characters,</li>
        <li>Consider the usefulness of each tag: If someone who was searching with that tag would like to see your
            story, or if somebody who had excluded that tag would not like to see your story, then add that tag.</li>
        <li>Smut fics should tag for the smutty stuff, especially if you think that somebody would be really into (or
            <em>not</em> into) something in particular.</li>
        <li>Include content warnings, or if you don't want to do that, set the fic for <b>Creator Chose Not To Use
                Archive Warnings</b>. Unless you select that option, the reader should be able to determine from the
            warnings and the tags why you chose the rating that you did.</li>
        <li>Don't say, “I don't know how to tag.” Don't say, “This is my first fic.” Readers can't smell your fear but
            they can sure as fuck <em>read</em> it, and nothing gets me to drop a fic faster than a sign that the author
            doesn't believe in their story. I know that you have doubts. I have doubts, too! But don't admit it right
            there in the open before the reader has even gotten a first impression.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I enjoy tagging as an art form, but it's easy to overdo things. Your tags should never detract from or overshadow
        the story itself. If you have any doubts, I suggest passing your proposed tags by a couple of people and seeing
        what they think. Kill your darlings like you're Michael Myers and it's your favorite day of the year.</p>

    <p>If you are looking for a tag but aren't sure what its most common form is, then you can <a

    <h4>Guide to Specific Tags</h4>

    <p>When you're ready to post your fic, check the preview to make sure that your tags are showing the way that you
        intended them to appear. AO3 will sometimes alter a tag if it thinks that your tag is related to another tag,
        and if you placed a character tag in the Additional Tags section then it may appear as “Freeform — [Character
        name].”</p>

    <p>
        <b>Relationship tags:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>The forward slash ( / ) denotes romantic or sexual relationships. The ampersand (&amp;) denotes platonic
            relationships. The heart (♥) denotes flushed relationships. The spade (♠) denotes caliginous… Wait, wrong
            fandom.</li>
        <li>Treat relationships like characters: there are main relationships, supporting relationships, and background
            relationships, and you should tag accordingly.</li>
        <li>Most, if not all, fics will have at least one main character, but not every fic will have a main
            relationship, let alone several.</li>
        <li>The relevance of a character isn't necessarily equal to the relevance of their relationship(s). If Harry is
            dating Ginny, but Ginny doesn't show up and his relationship with her is mentioned only in passing, then at
            least <em>consider</em> not tagging it Harry Potter/Ginny Weasley.</li>
        <li>Background X/Y has usually been wrangled to be identical to X/Y, and will show up / be excluded from
            searches accordingly. However, if you tag Background X/Y or Minor X/Y in the Additional Tags section, then
            you'll be able to mention a relationship without getting it wrangled with the main relationship tag.</li>
        <li>In the “Additional Tags” section, you might add tags to elaborate on the relationship, e.g. Enemies to
            Lovers, Friends to Lovers, Long Distance Relationship, Strangers to Enemies.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you have multiple relationships which break off or evolve as the story goes on, and you aren't sure in which
        order to list them, then ask yourself, “Which relationships will the story end with, and which relationships are
        most important to the story?” For example, if Alice and Bob are dating at the beginning of the story, but
        they're going to break up and Alice will get married to Charlie by the end, then you should list Alice/Charlie
        first and Alice/Bob last (in fact, if Alice and Bob break up very early on, then you should consider leaving
        Alice/Bob out of the relationship tags and just mentioning the breakup in the Additional Tags).</p>

    <p>If there are multiple “endgame” relationships, then try to list them in order of importance (for example, the
        relationships of your main characters) and then, wherever there are multiple equally-important relationships, in
        whatever order fits your fancy (I usually list them in order of appearance or in alphabetical order).</p>

        <b>Setting tags:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><a name="back1" rel="nofollow" id="back1"></a>If you would like to make it clear that your fic takes place
            during one of the primary seven books, then a tag like Book 6: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will
            work well. If your story is more or less canonical (remember that “canon” is a complex term in this fandom)
            then Canon Compliant may be useful, <em>especially</em> if you think that something about the fic might lead
            the reader to think that it's an AU.<a href="#note1" rel="nofollow"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
        <li>If the fic is canon compliant except for for some timeline divergences — if, in other words, it's an
            “alternate history” fic — then use Alternate Universe - Canon Divergence.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>If your canon divergence is centered on one of the books, then Canon Divergence - [Book] or Canon
                Divergence - Post-[Book] would also be good to include. For example, there are plenty of Canon
                Divergence - Post-Order of the Phoenix fics.</li>
            <li>Other common canon divergence tags are Alternate Universe - No [Character] (typically “No Voldemort”),
                Alternate Universe - No [Event] (typically “No Second Wizarding War” or something like that), and
                Alternate Universe - [Character] Lives.</li>
            <li>If you're just ignoring the epilogue, then Not Epilogue Compliant may be a good choice. Epilogue What
                Epilogue is also fairly common, and the two tags have been wrangled together.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>If your story diverges from canon in more fundamental ways (e.g. magic works very differently than in
            canon), then you might want to use tags like <b>Alternate Universe - Magical Cores</b> or <b>Alternate
                Universe - Soulmates</b>. You may want to check <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Alternate_Universe"
                rel="nofollow">Fanlore's page on AUs</a> or <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19vRx9JObs_te0elsebVoOK_aAeodKl7n/mobilebasic"
                rel="nofollow">the AU-pedia</a>, by Brianna-Imagination.</li>
        <li>If the bulk of your story is set during a time period outside the primary seven books, then consider using a
            tag like one of the following: <b>Hogwarts Founders Era </b>(c. A.D. 1000), <b>Riddle at Hogwarts Era
            </b>(1938-1945), <b>Pre-Marauders Era </b>(1945-1971), <b>Marauders Era </b>(1971-1978), <b>Post-Marauders
                Era </b>or <b>Pre-Philosopher's Stone </b>(1978-1991), and <b>Post-Deathly Hallows </b>(1997+). For fics
            set during (or near enough to) the events of <em>Fantastic Beasts </em>or <em>Cursed Child</em>, I recommend
            tagging your fic as belonging to those fandoms (as well as to Harry Potter) rather than using an “Era” tag,
            so that people will more successfully find or avoid your fic.</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Additionally, some fics posit an <b>Eighth Year </b>for Hogwarts, either in the normal course of things
                or in order to make up for that year where the school was run by Death Eaters. Technically speaking,
                Hermione Granger canonically lived out an Eighth Year.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>

    <p>
        <b>Miscellaneous tags:</b>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Tags may convey the tone or theme of your fic: e.g. Angst, Crack, Friendship, Fluff, Humor, Light-hearted,
            Marriage, Parenthood, Trauma. You might also decide to get more specific, e.g. Light Angst or Domestic
            Fluff.</li>
        <li>Tags may say something about the plot: e.g. Happy Ending, Hurt/Comfort, Mutual Pining, PWP, Romance, Slow
            Burn, Smut, Whump.</li>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Fix-it Fics </b>change something (sometimes many things) in canon that the author wasn't happy with,
                or perhaps that the main characters weren't happy with. They may be AUs or time travel fics, or even a
                canon compliant fic if the author is able to fit their “fix” in the gaps not shown in canon.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Tags may describe the format or structure of your fic, e.g. Art, Dialogue-only, Epistolary, <a
                href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Five_Things" rel="nofollow">Five Things</a>, Online Media / Social Media,
            Podfic, Poetry, Texting.</li>
        <li>Tags may provide content warnings, e.g. Child Abuse, Familial Abuse, Harm to Children, Suicide.</li>
        <li>If your main characters (and/or important supporting characters) have ended up in a different house, then
            tag the fic with <b>[House] [Character Name]</b> and <b>Alternate Hogwarts House Sorting</b>. Or, if they're
            in a different school, then use <b>[School] Student [Character Name]</b>. Only use <b>[School]</b> if the
            school will be important to the story; if everyone attends Beauxbatons but the story takes place exclusively
            during their summer vacation to Argentina, then you probably shouldn't tag it “Beauxbatons,” but if Hermione
            is a Beauxbatons student on vacation in Argentina, then “Beauxbatons Student Hermione Granger” might still
            be appropriate.</li>
        <li>Other tags you may find useful include <b>Not Beta Read </b>(often assigned as <b>no beta we die like [Remus
                Lupin, King Charles, etc.]</b>) and <b>Other Tags to Be Added</b>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I advise against using tags like <b>Drabble</b> or <b>Oneshot</b>, because this should be obvious from the word
        or chapter count, but you do whatever floats your boat.</p>
