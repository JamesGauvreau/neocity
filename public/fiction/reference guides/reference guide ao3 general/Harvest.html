    <h3>Formatting</h3>

    <p>Fanfiction.net is a dying nightmarescape held together by duct tape and Faustian bargains, whose founder
        disappeared years ago when the Devil came to collect his due for reasons that are a mystery to us all. I will
        speak of it no further except to say that, if that site is dying, then Ficwad is undead. Furthermore, I know
        nothing of Wattpad or whatever else the kids are posting on today.</p>

    <p>All of this is to say that my formatting advice is exclusively for posting on Archive of Our Own. If there are
        other guides for other websites, then I may add them to this list if you let me know of them.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/tags/Fanwork%20Research%20*a*%20Reference%20Guides" rel="nofollow">
            Fanwork Research &amp; Reference Guides </a> tag is a useful tag in general, which I recommend that you
        check if you're writing a crossover.</p>

    <p>“<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/149319#main" rel="nofollow">Sliding Doors</a>” is a “story” published
        by AO3 volunteers to demonstrate some of what you can do with normal CSS options available on the site. You can
        check out <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/admin_posts/119" rel="nofollow"> their tutorial </a> for more, or
        look at some of the guides below. If you think that something is missing from one of these lists, then let me

    <h3>Posting</h3>

    <p>If it's been more than a couple of weeks since your last update, then consider including a short recap in the
        chapter summary or opening notes. If it's been more than a month since your last update, then definitely include
        a short recap.</p>

    <p>If you think that it would be a good idea to make a content warning but you don't want to spoil things for people
        who don't want to be told about anything, then you can give the content warning in the chapter's end notes, and
        mention the presence of the content warning in the chapter's beginning notes.</p>

            they're useful not just for fannish historians like myself but for readers, whose expectations will often be
            shaped by the publication date (e.g. pre-2007 stories have no chance of being DH-compliant).</li>
