    <h1>Please Read and Review!</h1>
    <p>If you write fanfiction, then <b>comment on other people's fanfiction</b>! This doesn't have to be a big, complicated affair. Two or three sentences — hell, even one sentence, if that's all you're able to do — can be great. If you don't comment on other people's stories then you can't expect them to comment on yours. I don't believe in God but I do believe in Writer's Karma. </p>

<p><strong>If you have something negative to say</strong> about a story, then use the Sandwich Format: 1 positive thing, 1 negative thing, and 1 positive thing. Typos are fair game to point out but for the love of God, make sure that you have something positive to say as well (and if you're commenting on an ongoing story then I recommend that you ask, in your initial comment, whether typo-picking will be welcome). </p><ul>
<li>“<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/31564040" rel="nofollow">So you want to comment (when you are nervous about commenting)</a>,” by another_binks, gives a few ideas about what to write in your comment. </li>
<li>“<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/42112920/chapters/105728832" rel="nofollow">commenter's block: the lesser known cousin of writer's block</a>,” by Anonymous, talks about potential roadblocks to commenting (e.g. not knowing what to say) and how to overcome them. There are also some useful links, some of which I've included below (mostly tools) and others that I haven't (mostly advice). </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="https://longlivefeedback.tumblr.com/post/170952243543/now-presenting-the-llf-comment-builder-beta" rel="nofollow"> LLF Comment Builder </a> is a spreadsheet (available in both online and offline forms) that provides a customizable scaffold to help assemble comments as simple or as long as you'd like. The tutorial is pretty straightforward. </p>

<p>There are also a few browser extensions which you might find helpful. These rely on Tampermonkey, which you can install on <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo" rel="nofollow"> Chrome</a>, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/" rel="nofollow"> FireFox</a>, and other browsers. In my experience, the script won't always load on a page, but if you refresh the page a couple of times then it'll kick in. If you're having trouble, <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/athos-silvani/157221895492/rederiswrites-linguini17-ravenel-i-saw" rel="nofollow"> this Tumblr post</a> might help. </p><ul>
<li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/427903-ao3-comment-assist" rel="nofollow">AO3 Comment Assist</a>, by Van Irie, which prompts you to leave a comment when you hit the kudos button. By default, the extension also deposits (in the comment box) a commenting guide for people who haven't commented before, but you can replace this with a short comment prompt or just turn it off. To do so, you'll need to navigate to your Tampermonkey dashboard and select “ao3 Comment Assist.” Below //SETUP// will be a line reading “var assist_type = 1,” and below <em>that</em> is key to explain settings 1, 2, and 3. If you prefer one of the other settings, then change the 1 to a 2 or a 3 and then install (or reinstall) the script. The random comment prompt is determined when the page loads, so if you want a different prompt then you'll need to refresh the page and hit the Kudos button again. </li>
<li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/395902-ao3-floating-comment-box" rel="nofollow">AO3 Floating Comment Box</a>, by ScriptMouse, creates a little blue button in the upper-left corner of your screen when you're on a fic's page. If you click that button, it creates a box at the bottom of your screen which you can write in and move around, and which will automatically scroll when you do. I prefer to write comments as I read, so this is a big help, and as an added bonus, you can immediately tell whether Tampermonkey loaded everything by checking whether the blue button is there. When you create the floating box, the blue button will be replaced by a red button, which you can click in order to remove the floating box. </li>
<li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/427421-ao3-rekudos-converter" rel="nofollow">AO3 ReKudos Converter</a>, by Van Irie, which adds to the comment box, “This is an extra kudos, since I've already left one. :)” I caution against overusing this without adding anything else in your comment, because a couple of bonus kudos can be heartwarming but getting 30 notifications that say the same thing can be annoying. If an author gets 30 normal kudos then they'll receive a single email which tallies their kudos, but if they get 30 kudo-comments then they'll receive 30 emails (and their AO3 inbox will have 30 comments). </li>
</ul>

<p>I can't say it enough: Do you enjoy it when somebody leaves a comment on your story? Other authors are just as hungry for comments. </p>
