    <h1>Norms and Etiquette</h1>
    <p><a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Recursive_Fanfiction" rel="nofollow"> Recursive fanfiction</a>, or fanfiction
        of other people's fanfiction, can be controversial. Some people don't believe that you should write it without
        permission, and some people think you shouldn't write it at all. I think that this is bullshit. I will usually
        ask permission before I write recursive fanfiction, but I view this as an issue of politeness rather than
        morality, and I rarely ask permission to use an element of someone's story in my own (e.g. characters,
        worldbuilding). What I do think is genuinely important is <em> giving credit</em>.</p>
