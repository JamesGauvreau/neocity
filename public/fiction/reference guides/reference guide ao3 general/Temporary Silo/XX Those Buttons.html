    <h2>Profile</h2>
    <p>Things that I recommend adding to your profile:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/Blanket_Statement" rel="nofollow">Blanket statement</a> giving permission
            for derivative works based on your own fan works.</li>
        <li>Some information about yourself and how you fit into fandom: how did you get into this, what have you done
            here, and maybe some other stuff. Betts has written about <a
                href="https://bettsfic.tumblr.com/post/184971117987/socknography-the-importance-of-preserving-fan"
                rel="nofollow">the importance of fan author biographies</a> and has suggestions for other things to
            include if you're willing to get more detailed. As a historian of Harry Potter fandom, I can't stress enough
            how plausible it is that somebody might track down your fic and have some questions about its author, twenty
            years after you wrote it.</li>
