    <p>Telling somebody to write is sort of like telling somehow how to cook. There are a number of universal principles
        &ndash; e.g. try not to serve literal poison &ndash; but different cuisines call for different approaches, to
        say nothing of tailoring your dish for readers who hate dairy, cooks who are allergic to pepper, et cetera. If a
        suggestion doesn't seem to work for you, then it probably doesn't work for you. The only hard-and-fast rule that
        I will recommend is that you try lots of things in order to find out what does work.</p>
    <p>Besides what's here, you may want to read “<a

    <h1>On Chapter Length <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>

    <p>I recommend that your chapters be between 3,000 and 10,000 words, but there are plenty of reasons to ignore this
        recommendation (and sometimes there isn't a good reason but you'll do it anyway, which I'll admit to being
        guilty of). Good examples of short exceptions include “<a
            href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/3733492/1/The-Apprentice-and-the-Necromancer" rel="nofollow">The
            Apprentice and the Necromancer</a>,” by satismagic, is composed of chapters around 1,000 words long. You
        might also want to include an unusually short chapter for effect: “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/5627803/chapters/12963046" rel="nofollow">Animorphs: The
            Reckoning</a>,” “<a href="https://hpmor.com/" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter and the Methods of
            Rationality</a>,” and “<a href="https://parahumans.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Worm</a>” each have a
        single-sentence chapter at some point.</p>

    <p>It's much easier for a chapter to be too long than too short, because the reader might lose their place
        (especially if the chapter is too long to read in a single sitting). One of the worst examples of a too-long
        chapter is “<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/2452681/1/Evil-Be-Thou-My-Good" rel="nofollow">Evil Be Thou My
            Good</a>,” by Ruskbyte, which is a 40,000 word oneshot. It's a monster to read and there are plenty of
        places where a chapter break would be easy to insert, so there's really no excuse, unless Ruskbyte was trying to
        give their readers some sympathy for the characters that he sends to Hell. Just because you've written a
        dragon's hoard of words in one go, that's no reason to post them all at once — and if you do, you can still post
        multiple <em> chapters </em> at once.</p>

    <p>Also, the longer your chapter is, the harder it'll be for readers to address everything that they want to talk
        about when they comment on your fic. It's a lot easier to write one paragraph each for eight 5,000 word chapters
        than to write eight paragraphs for one 80,000 word chapter, not least because the reader might forget some of
        their thoughts by the time they're done!</p>

    <p>Was Voldemort driven insane by making too many Horcruxes? Will a transfigured armchair remain an armchair
        indefinitely? Do people die if they are killed? These questions, and many like them, do not have
        universally-accepted answers in the fandom. As a general rule, you should consider which characteristics of
        magic or the world in general will be Important to your story and then make sure to broadcast those
        characteristics ahead of time.</p>

    <p>For example, if the permanency of transfigurations will play a crucial role in your story, then you should make
        sure that it's discussed in class, or that your POV character thinks about this, or <em> something </em>.
        Likewise, if, when you're considering potential reader objections to an important scene, you think that somebody
        might ask why Luna Lovegood didn't simply Apparate across the Channel in order to save her beloved Roonil
        Wazlib, then you should make it clear at some earlier point that a large enough body of water will impede
        Apparition. </p>

    <p>If the matter is very important, then you may want to establish the relevant facts twice or even thrice (the
        Three Clue Rule is that if you want the audience to notice something, then you'll probably need to mention it at
        least three times; its corollary is that a lone act of foreshadowing will often go unnoticed until the time is
        right).</p>

    <h1>On Writing Descriptions <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>

    <p>From time to time, I am told that I have written a very beautiful visual description of something, but I can
        hardly imagine what they see. I write in the way that <em> Portia</em>, the brilliant jumping spider, calculates
        a hunting path: methodically, a single piece at a time, without ever holding the whole thing in my head at once.
        Sometimes I'll assemble a bunch of these pieces together; and other times I will, like a Chinese room, output a
        string of text that is mostly without meaning to me but appears to make sense to my readers. </p>

    <p>I rely on my beta readers to tell me whether the finally product makes sense to people who have two
        fully-functioning mental eyes. Occasionally, one of them will ask what was going on with a certain scene or how
        something is supposed to “look,” and I have to stop and think and be <em> Portia </em> again in order to decode
        it, because I just wrote a string of text that “felt right,” sort of like how ChatGPT tries to write passages
        which fit previously-trained data. </p>

    <p>One thing that helps me is to collect descriptions ahead of time. Sometimes these will be specific snippets,
        generated while I'm thinking about the story or the scene and sometimes the sort of thing that just occurs to
        you while you're trying to sleep. Other times they're more general: I have a Google doc with flavors of beer,
        the shapes of leaves, the smells of mushrooms… I collect everything and anything, because precision and detail
        make the scene stand out. Once you've finished writing, reread the passage and take note of places where you've
        been vague and said “it” or “something,” and at least <em> consider </em> whether it's possible to be more
        specific. For a gold star, make sure that every scene hits each of the five senses at least one time. </p>

    <p>Something else to consider is your point-of-view character, and specifically how their point of view differs from
        yours. In the Worm fandom, it's common for people to say that the narrating character, Taylor Hebert, is gay (or
        maybe bisexual), because she's written by a straight dude who describes women like a person who is attracted to
        women. On the same principle, have you ever realized that an author was white because you noticed that every
        time a character's skin color was mentioned, that character wasn't white? When you're writing a scene, think
        about what's normal to your narrator or viewpoint character, and don't mention it so much; and think about
        what's unusual to them, and make sure to mention that. </p>

    <p>But if there's just one takeaway, it's this: <b>Be particular! Avoid “it” and “ones” and other vagaries wherever
            possible.</b></p>
