    <p>If you're having trouble with Archive of Our Own, you can check whether it's a you-problem at AO3 Status on <a
            href="https://bsky.app/profile/status.archiveofourown.org">Bluesky</a>. You can also check with <a
            href="https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/archive-of-our-own">Down for Everyone</a> and <a
            href="https://www.isitdownrightnow.com/archiveofourown.org.html">Is It Down?</a>, but those two services
        will sometimes say that AO3 is down when it isn't.</p>
    <p><b>There is no official app for Archive of Our Own.</b> There will probably never be an official app for Archive
        of Our Own. If you use an AO3 app, please understand that there are security risks – you are handing out your
        login information to somebody that is not associated with the Archive – and if you encounter technical problems
        then there is nobody that can help you except whoever built the app.</p>

    <h1>Comfy-fy Your Reading Experience <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <p><b>You are responsible for your own consumption of media.</b> The Archive of Our Own is more modular than many
        other websites: Not only can you read the tags of a work in order to decide whether that work is right for you,
        but you can even use site "skins" to hide works with a given tag so that you don't see these in the first place.
        If the work's creator has properly tagged their work, they are not responsible for any bad feelings that may
        arise as you read or view it.</p>
    <h2>Caveat Lector</h2>
    <p>But what <i>is</i> "proper tagging," exactly? I'll delve deeper into this more deeply in the Tagging Guide, but
        it's worth noting that there are two kinds of tags that authors are required to observe:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Rating tags, which range from "General Audiences" to "Explicit," as well as "Not Rated." You can read more
            about Rating tags, including their definitions, <a
                href="https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#ratings_list">here</a>, in the AO3 FAQ.</li>
        <li>Archive Warning tags, which principally include "Graphic Depictions of Violence," "Major Character Death,"
            "Rape/Non-Con," and "Underage Sex." You can read more about them <a
                href="https://archiveofourown.org/tos_faq#warnings_list">here</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are a couple of special Archive Warning tags that it's important to not confuse: "No Archive Warnings
        Apply" means that the specific Archive Warning tags mentioned above do not apply, <i>and nothing else</i>. If
        someone crafts the most horrifying piece of fiction imaginable, fit to give you nightmares for weeks, but there
        is no violence, no death, and no sexual content, then they have every right to tag it, "No Archive Warnings
        Apply." Pay attention to the work's other tags, including the Rating tag (I would probably not rate The Most
        Terrifying Fanfic Ever Written as being for "General Audiences").
    <p>The other Archive Warning tag to keep straight is "Author Chose Not to Use Archive Warnings." Occasionally,
        someone will confuse this with the first tag, but it is the Archive Warning equivalent to "Not Rated." The
        author might have written saccharine fluff or something that hits every single Archive Warning, but they have
        still tagged their work appropriately. Pay attention to the work's Rating tag, other tags, and summary in order
        to gauge whether the work will probably be appropriate for you.</p>
    <p>If you read a fic tagged with Not Rated or Author Chose Not to Use Archive Warnings and get upset because there
        is adult material or graphic violence or whatever, this is like chugging a bottle of acetaminophen and then
        blaming the drugstore when your liver pops.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Reporting Fics on AO3</h2>
    <p>The good people who volunteer at Archive of Our Own are, um, volunteers. Every report that you make must be
        processed by <i>somebody</i>, and if the report is baseless then you've just wasted the time of the good folks
        on the Polcy & Abuse Team. Here are a few things that people often get mixed up about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>People <b>are not</b> allowed to monetize their works on AO3.</li>
        <li>People <b>are</b> allowed to link to other websites, and talk about monetization on those websites.</li>
        <li>People <b>are</b> allowed to write, draw, and discuss things that you think are squicky.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Site Skins</h2>
    <p>“<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/41589201/chapters/104315178" rel="nofollow">How to Block Tags With
            Site Skins (And Get Real Specific About It)</a>,” by najio, doesn't just let you block tags, but also
        lets you highlight them, block stories by particular authors or by the number of tags, and more. <span>There is
            also a

    <h2>Tampermonkey Scripts</h2>
    <p>Tampermonkey is a browser extension that allows you to modify web pages. You can find it wherever you can get
        extensions for your browser (links for <a
            href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo">Chrome</a>, <a
            href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search">Firefox</a>,
        <a href="https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/>">Opera</a>).

        <summary>Using Tampermonkey is simple. Click this paragraph for a quick tutorial. </summary>
        </p>
        <div style="border-style: solid; border-width: 2px; padding: 1%;">
            <p>After you've added it to your browser, click the extension and then click onto the
                dashboard, as seen in the images below.</p>
            <img src="https://archiveofourown.org/images/ao3_logos/logo_42.png">
            <p>From the Dashboard, you can see which scripts you've downloaded, turn them on or off, and click
                individual
                scripts in order to modify them further.</p>
            <img src="https://archiveofourown.org/images/ao3_logos/logo_42.png">
            <!-- <p>Refer to <code>this section</code> for general guidance on using Tampermonkey.</p> -->
            <p>Adding a script is as easy as clicking the install button.</p>

        </div>
    </details>
    <p>Scripts that I recommend include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/424852-ao3-highlight-tags-v2">AO3: highlight tags V2</a>, by
            Fangirlishness, lets you define tags and assign colors which highlight those tags on AO3. The top of the
            script
            includes instructions and examples.</li>
        <li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/scripts/3144-ao3-kudos-hits-ratio">AO3: Kudos/hits ratio</a>, by Min,
            replaces a
            work's hit count with a percentage based on the Kudos-to-hits ratio: how many people, after clicking into
            the
            story, proceeded to give Kudos? </li>
        <li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/users/36620">AO3 tweak formatting</a>, by scriptfairy, allows you to
            adjust
            the formatting of a work, e.g. removing the extra line break that shows up between paragraphs in some works.
            You
            just have to click the "Tweak Format" button, which shows up in the lower-right corner of the work's Summary
            section. You'll need to make the tweak on every chapter, every time you read it, but on the bright side if
            you
            fuck something up then you can fix it by refreshing the page.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- You are largely responsible for your experience on Archive of Our Own. So long as an author tags their work responsibly, it is not their fault if you read a story and have a bad time because of something that was mentioned in the tags. It is also not their fault if you have a bad time because just seeing the tag upset you. -->

    <h1>Please Read and Review! <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <p>Nobody publishes on Archive of Our Own because they don't want people to read what they wrote. <b>Comment on
            other people's works!</b> If nobody commented, then very few people would publish.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>But what if it's been a long time since the work was published?</i> They'll love a comment!</li>
        <li><i>No, I mean a really long time, like eight or nine months.</i> It is possible that I have commented on
            works that are older than you are.</li>
        <li><i>But what if they don't want to receive comments anymore?</i> Then they can delete their work, or orphan
            it, or leave a note asking you to not comment. </li>
        <li><i>But I don't know what to say.</i> Tell them, "I really liked this. Thank you for writing it." If you feel
            up to the job, name a specific thing that you liked.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This goes double if you write! Commenting doesn't have to be a big, complicated affair. Two or three sentences —
        hell, even one sentence, if that's all you're able to do — can be
        great. If you don't comment on other people's stories then you can't expect them to comment on yours. I don't
        believe in God but I do believe in Writer's Karma.</p>
    <p>I can't say it enough: Do you enjoy it when somebody leaves a comment on your story? Other authors are just as
        hungry for comments.</p>

        <h3>A Word on LLMs, etc.</h3>
        <p>For the purpose of this reference guide, it does not particularly matter whether you think that work produced
            by or with the assistance of LLMs and other generative AI is "art" or "valid" or whatever. <b>It is in your
                interest to not send mean comments to people who use these things.</b> </p>
        <p>I am not saying that you need to leave enthusiastic reviews on these works. But remember what I said about
            being responsible for your own media experience: You don't have to read these works, either, and <b>your
                ability to avoid LLM-based works depends in part on other people's willingness to tag their works
                appropriately</b>.</p>
        <p> Like it or not, leaving mean comments will not single-handedly fix anything. It will just drive people to
            stop tagging their works – making it harder for you to avoid works that you don't want to read – and earn
            you a warning from Policy & Abuse.</p>
        <p>If you don't like this, then <a

                $10 to AO3 and become a voting member</a>, and elect board members who will enact the policies that you
            would prefer to see.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>How to Review</h2>
    <p><strong>If you have something negative to say</strong> about a story, then use the Sandwich Format: 1 positive
        thing, 1 negative thing, and 1 positive thing. Typos are fair game to point out but for the love of God, make
        sure that you have something positive to say as well (and if you're commenting on an ongoing story then it is
        polite to ask, in your initial comment, whether typo-picking will be welcome).</p>
    <p>If you don't know what to write, then the following resources may be helpful:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/31564040" rel="nofollow">So you want to comment (when you are
                nervous about commenting)</a>,” by another_binks, gives a few ideas about what to write in your
            comment.</li>
        <li>“<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/42112920/chapters/105728832" rel="nofollow">commenter's block:
                the lesser known cousin of writer's block</a>,” by Anonymous, talks about potential roadblocks to
            commenting (e.g. not knowing what to say) and how to overcome them. There are also some useful links, some
            of which I've included below (mostly tools) and others that I haven't (mostly advice).</li>
        <li>The <a
                href="https://longlivefeedback.tumblr.com/post/170952243543/now-presenting-the-llf-comment-builder-beta"
                rel="nofollow"> LLF Comment Builder</a> is a spreadsheet (available in both online and offline forms)
            that
            provides a customizable scaffold to help assemble comments as simple or as long as you'd like. The tutorial
            is
            pretty straightforward.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There are also a few scripts that you might find helpful. These rely on the Tampermonkey extension, which I
        discuss in <a href="#TampermonkeyHowTo">this section</a>. In my experience, the script won't always load on a
        page,
        but if you refresh the page a couple of times then it'll kick in. If you're having trouble, <a
            href="https://www.tumblr.com/athos-silvani/157221895492/rederiswrites-linguini17-ravenel-i-saw"
            rel="nofollow"> this Tumblr post</a> might help.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/427903-ao3-comment-assist" rel="nofollow">AO3 Comment Assist</a>,
            by Van Irie, which prompts you to leave a comment when you hit the kudos button. By default, the extension
            also deposits (in the comment box) a commenting guide for people who haven't commented before, but you can
            replace this with a short comment prompt or just turn it off. To do so:
            <ol>
                <li>Navigate to your Tampermonkey dashboard.</li>
                <li>Select "ao3 Comment Assist.</li>
                <li>Below //SETUP// will be a line reading “var assist_type = 1.”</li>
                <li>Below <em>that</em> is key to explain settings 1, 2, and 3.</li>
                <li>If you prefer one of the other settings, then change the 1 to a 2 or a 3 and then install (or
                    reinstall) the script.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The random comment prompt is determined when the page loads, so if you want a different prompt then
                you'll need to refresh the page and hit the Kudos button again.</p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/395902-ao3-floating-comment-box" rel="nofollow">AO3 Floating
                Comment Box</a>, by ScriptMouse, creates a little blue button in the upper-left corner of your screen
            when you're on a fic's page. If you click that button, it creates a box at the bottom of your screen which
            you can write in and move around, and which will automatically scroll when you do. I prefer to write
            comments as I read, so this is a big help, and as an added bonus, you can immediately tell whether
            Tampermonkey loaded everything by checking whether the blue button is there. When you create the floating
            box, the blue button will be replaced by a red button, which you can click in order to remove the floating
            box.</li>
        <li><a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/427421-ao3-rekudos-converter" rel="nofollow">AO3 ReKudos
                Converter</a>, by Van Irie, which adds to the comment box, “This is an extra kudos, since I've already
            left one. :)” I caution against overusing this without adding anything else in your comment, because a
            couple of bonus kudos can be heartwarming but getting 30 notifications that say the same thing can be
            annoying. If an author gets 30 normal kudos then they'll receive a single email that tallies their kudos,
            but if they get 30 kudo-comments then they'll receive 30 emails (and their AO3 inbox will have 30
            comments).</li>
    </ul>
