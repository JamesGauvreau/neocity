    <h1>Navigating AO3: Finding Works</h1>
    <h2>Comfy-fy Your Reading Experience</h2>
    <h3>Caveat Lector</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for your own consumption of media. The Archive of Our Own is more modular than many other
        websites â€“ not only can you read a work's tags in order to decide whether that work is right for you, but you
        can even use a site skin that hides works with a given tag, so that you don't even see them in the first place.
        Assuming that the work's creator has properly tagged their work, they are not responsible for any bad feelings
        that may arise.
        <ul id="note">
