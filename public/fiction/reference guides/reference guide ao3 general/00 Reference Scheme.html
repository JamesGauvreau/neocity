    <h1>AO3 Etiquette</h1>

    <h2>Comfy-fy Your Reading Experience</h2>
    <h3>Caveat Lector</h3>
    <p>You are responsible for your own consumption of media. The Archive of Our Own is more modular than many other
        websites â€“ not only can you read a work's tags in order to decide whether that work is right for you, but you
        can even use a site skin that hides works with a given tag, so that you don't even see them in the first place.
        Assuming that the work's creator has properly tagged their work, they are not responsible for any bad feelings
        that may arise.
    <ul id="note">
        <li>What is reportable vs not reportable.
            <ul>
                <li>People ARE NOT allowed to monetize their works or anything else on AO3.</li>
                <li>People ARE allowed to link to other websites, where they can talk about monetization.</li>
                <li>People ARE allowed to write or draw things that you think are squicky.</li>
            </ul>

    <h1>Posting on AO3</h1>
    <p id="note">Useful tools for formatting stories on AO3 with a minimum of fuss, to avoid weird spaces and extra line
        breaks.</p>
    <h2>Story Meta</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>"<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3221720" rel="nofollow">Dates Matter: or why do I care when your
                work was first published</a>," by snowgall, is about the importance of accurate publishing dates:
            they're useful not just for fannish historians like myself but for readers, whose expectations will often be
            shaped by the publication date (e.g. pre-2007 stories have no chance of being DH-compliant).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tagging Guide</h3>
    <p id="note">Guidelines on when to use non-story related tags.</p> 
    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>If it's been more than a couple of weeks since your last update, then consider including a short recap in the
        chapter summary or opening notes. If it's been more than a month since your last update, then definitely include
        a short recap.</p>
    <h2>Opening / Closing Notes</h2>
    <p>If you think that it would be a good idea to make a content warning but you don't want to spoil things for people
        who don't want to be told about anything, then you can give the content warning in the chapter's end notes, and
        mention the presence of the content warning in the chapter's beginning notes.</p>

    <h2>Formatting</h2>
    <p id="note">How to format with HTML.</p>
    <p>Fanfiction.net is a dying nightmarescape held together by duct tape and Faustian bargains, whose founder
        disappeared years ago when the Devil came to collect his due for reasons that are a mystery to us all. I will
        speak of it no further except to say that, if that site is dying, then Ficwad is undead. Furthermore, I know
        nothing of Wattpad or whatever else the kids are posting on today.</p>

    <p>All of this is to say that my formatting advice is exclusively for posting on Archive of Our Own. If there are
        other guides for other websites, then I may add them to this list if you let me know of them.</p>
