    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter has no summary.</p>
    <h2>Questions / Thoughts without a home yet.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Where should a discussion of bookmarks (public vs private, recommendations) go?</li>
        <li>General overview of the OTW? Probably should at least mention Fanlore, since it's a useful resource.</li>
        <li>Using (or not using) bots/LLMs.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you use LLMs, then you should be clear about what you're using them for, etc. If you hate it when
                other people use LLMs, do not flame people for using them: you'll only drive the LLM users into hiding.

        <li>https://archiveofourown.org/works/42103392/chapters/128424691#workskin</li>
        <li>I'm thinking that the "Navigating AO3" chapters should be interleaved with the other chapters, placed where
            relevant, but (1) maybe this is not so and (2) maybe it is so, but they should come after rather than
            before.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Refer to equivalents for kudos, bookmarks, etc., eg bookmarks on AO3 are like Favorites on FFN, like ? on
        Wattpad, etc. "This thing on AO3 is like that thing on the whatsit you're more familiar with." Doc manager on
        FFN is like "Save as draft" on AO3. </p>

    <h1>AO3 Etiquette</h1>
    <p id="note">This is at least partly a recap of other notes in other chapters. Trying to formalize and increase
        awareness of traditional fandom etiquette, e.g. comment/review norms, YKINMK. Cf. <a
            href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Three_Laws_of_Fandom">three laws of fandom</a>.</p>
    <p id="note">Not sure where this should actually fall in the order of chapters. Feels like either first or last.</p>

    <h1>Navigating AO3: Finding Works</h1>
    <p id="note">Filtering and searching for fics. Ways to narrow down your search results. Keywords and symbols for the
        "search within results" field.</p>
    <h2>Comfy-fy Your Reading Experience</h2>
    <ul id="note">
        <li>Installing and using Tampermonkey</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Maybe discuss Tampermonkey earlier/elsewhere, and refer back to it when necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Wherever it's discussed, also refer to <a
                href="https://archiveofourown.org/faq/unofficial-browser-tools?language_id=en">this</a>.</li>
        <li>Using <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/3579-ao3-savior">ao3 savior</a> and <a
                href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/13274-ao3-crossover-savior">ao3 crossover savior</a> to hide
            works based on tags.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Caveat Lector</h3>
    <ul id="note">
        <ul>
            <li>If a fic has "Chose Not to Warn," be careful even if you don't see any tags that you'd consider a
                warning. Extra tags are not a requirement! There could be dead baby cannibals who say bad words, and you
                can't be mad about it.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Site Skins</h3>
    <ul id="note">
        <li>How to find, install, modify skins, including the following: <ul>
                <li>How to block stories based on the number or type of tags.</li>
                <li>How to hide tags.</li>
                <li>How to reorganize how tags are displayed.</li>

    </ul>
    <h1>Navigating AO3: Reading Works</h1>
    <p id="note">Downloading fics, and what happens when you download them (e.g. the skins get borked). Downloading and
        using Calibre.</p>
    <p id="note">The details tag; clicking it.</p>
    <h2>What the Buttons Mean</h2>
    <h2>Bookmarks</h2>
    <p id="note">Difference between private and public bookmarks. What recs are.</p>
    <h1>Reading</h1>
    <ul id="note">
        <li><a href="https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com/archive-of-our-own">Is it down?</a></li>
        <li>There is no official AO3 app. There probably will never be an official AO3 app.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Commenting</h2>
    <ul id="note">
        <li>Etiquette around commenting.</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Beta Reading</h2>

    </ul>

    <h1>Posting on AO3</h1>
    <p id="note">Useful tools for formatting stories on AO3 with a minimum of fuss, to avoid weird spaces and extra
        line
        breaks.</p>
    <h2>Story Meta</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>"<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/3221720" rel="nofollow">Dates Matter: or why do I care when
                your
                work was first published</a>," by snowgall, is about the importance of accurate publishing dates:
            they're useful not just for fannish historians like myself but for readers, whose expectations will
            often be
            shaped by the publication date (e.g. pre-2007 stories have no chance of being DH-compliant).</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tagging Guide</h3>
    <p id="note">Guidelines on when to use non-story related tags.</p>
    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>If it's been more than a couple of weeks since your last update, then consider including a short recap in the
        chapter summary or opening notes. If it's been more than a month since your last update, then definitely
        include
        a short recap.</p>
    <h2>Opening / Closing Notes</h2>
    <p>If you think that it would be a good idea to make a content warning but you don't want to spoil things for
        people
        who don't want to be told about anything, then you can give the content warning in the chapter's end notes,
        and
        mention the presence of the content warning in the chapter's beginning notes.</p>

    <h2>Formatting</h2>
    <p id="note">How to format with HTML + How to use VS Code (both of these will probably be extremely sketchy and
        mostly point in the direction of existing tutorials elsewhere).</p>
    <p>Fanfiction.net is a dying nightmarescape held together by duct tape and Faustian bargains, whose founder
        disappeared years ago when the Devil came to collect his due for reasons that are a mystery to us all. I
        will
        speak of it no further except to say that, if that site is dying, then Ficwad is undead. Furthermore, I know
        nothing of Wattpad or whatever else the kids are posting on today.</p>

    <p>All of this is to say that my formatting advice is exclusively for posting on Archive of Our Own. If there
        are
        other guides for other websites, then I may add them to this list if you let me know of them.</p>
    <h2>Work Skins</h2>
    <p id="note">How to use work skins, including a list of work skins that are neat or just plain useful, like work
        skins for emulating social media.</p>

    <h1>Navigating AO3: Exchanges, et cet.</h1>
    <h1>[Organizing Your Work]</h1>
    <p id="note">All of this could fit into previous chapters but they also fit together. Probably okay to repeat
        information in order to make it easier for the user to find.</p>
    <ul id="note">
        <li>Collections, series, etc.</li>
        <li>How to Anonymize your work, how to orphan them, difference between these.</li>
        <li>How to use Series and/or Collections to package large numbers of small fics in a way that works well
            with
            the Archive's tagging system, instead of cramming them all into a single unsearchable ficlet bin. Also,
            why
            you might not want to do that, and what you can do instead.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Appendix: AO3 Stylesheet</h1>
    <p id="note">A copy of the stylesheet that AO3 uses, breaking down what the different bits mean. Will need to
        include a disclaimer that AO3 might update their stylesheet without my notice, etc. etc.</p>
