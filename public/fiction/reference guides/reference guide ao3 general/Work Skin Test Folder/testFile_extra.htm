                    <span>Jack Skellington, having regained his zest for
                      Halloween but feeling no less curious about other holidays,
                      decides to visit Easter Town, whose resident rabbits — all
                      of them the children, grandchildren, and other relatives of
                      the Easter Bunny — are just as eager to learn about their
                      visitor. The first act is largely a comedy of errors and
                      cultural misunderstandings, all received in good spirit: for
                      example, when Jack Skellington learns of the Easter
                      association with resurrection, he calls for Doctor
                      Finkelstein and a number of body-snatchers
                      (“resurrectionists”) to demonstrate Halloween Town’s own
                      talent at raising the dead. </span>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>Adversity strikes when the Easter Bunny falls
                      dreadfully ill at a banquet and dies just a few days before
                      she is due to make her annual delivery of Easter Eggs. Jack
                      does his best to settle animosities in the succession crisis
                      that ensues among her many descendants, but disaster is only
                      averted on the third day, when the Easter Bunny hatches from
                      one of her own eggs (the “rabbits” of Easter Town are
                      monotremes). She informs Jack that this happens every year,
                      actually, but appreciates his efforts nonetheless. </span>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span>When Jack returns to Halloween Town several rabbits go
                      with him, excited by the opportunity to date somebody that
                      isn’t their cousin. </span>
