                <p>This document approximates the formatting that you'll encounter on AO3. It includes live links to the stylesheets that are used on AO3, in case those are updated, but if there's a big change with HTML then that won't be covered here.</p>
                <p class="testColor">The topmost stylesheet link is connected to workSkin.css, which currently has one class, "testColor," whose effect you can see here (if this paragraph isn't blue, something is wrong).</p>
                <p>If you download testFile_extra.html (this page) and workSkin.css, then put them in the same folder, then everything should work right. Again, if the second paragraph of this summary is not blue, then something is wrong.</p>
                <p>The work summary is contained in a <code>blockquote</code> with the class <code>userstuff</code>, which is contained in a <code>div</code> with the class <code>summary module</code>.</p>

                  <p>Technically speaking, something like <code>preface group</code> is really two classes, <code>preface</code> and <code>group</code>, but the order of these groups matters (i.e. <code>preface group</code> will not necessarily look the same as <code>group preface</code>), so in some ways it's helpful to think of them as a single class with particular building blocks.</p>
                <h1>Self-demonstrating Header 1</h1>
                  <p>There are three types of header here in case you want to experiment with modifying those (I personally dislike how the header types are so different from each other, so I often modify them).</p>
                <h2>Header 2</h2>
                  <p>Do you see what I mean about them being too different from each other? If I want to nest them, there's no consistency! Look at that huge gap between Header 2 and this paragraph, which doesn't happen with either Header 1 or Header 2.</p>
                <h3>Header 3</h3>
                  <p>Anyway, let me know if you notice any problems with this page, and I'll try to fix them.</p>
