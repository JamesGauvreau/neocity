    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter has no summary.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>In the latter half of the 16th century, there began a trend of using surnames as given names. This is where we get the name “Neville,” for example.</p>

<p>I've made a quick list of noteworthies whose surnames might conceivably be used as given names. Where one of these surnames has actually seen use in (some form of) canon, I've noted that.</p><h1>Heads of Hogwarts</h1><ol>
<li><b>Creaseworthy</b>, after Dame Antonia Creaseworthy, 17th century Headmistress</li>
<li><b>Derwent</b>, after Dilys Derwent, 18th century Headmistress and Healer, regarded as one of the school's “most celebrated Heads.” Attested in Derwent Shimpling, b. 1912, in the video games.</li>
<li><b>Everard</b>, a Headmaster with no specified given name or term of service, who was regarded as one of the school's “most celebrated Heads.”</li>
<li><b>Fitzgerald</b>, after Niamh Fitzgerald, 15th century Headmistress.</li>
<li><b>Limebert</b>, after Limebert, a Headmaster with no specified given name or term of service.</li>
<li><b>Skanderberg</b>, after Edessa Skanderberg, 16th century Headmistress and Historian, regarded as Britain's first “Muggleologist.”</li>
<li><b>Spore</b>, after Dame Phyllida Spore, 15th century Headmistress, Herbologist, and author of One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi.</li>
<li><b>Trimble</b>, after Quentin Trimble, Headmaster (century unknown) and author of <em>The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection</em>.</li>
<li><b>Undercliffe</b>, after Fytherley Undercliffe, 16th century Headmaster.</li>
<li><b>Viridian</b>, after Vindictus Viridian, 18th century Headmaster, Potioneer, and author of many books.</li>
</ol><h1>Ministers for Magic</h1><ol>
<li><b>Crickerly</b>, after Venusia Crickerly (served 1903-1912), former Auror and popular Minister for Magic, died in office (freak gardening accident).</li>
<li><b>Crowdy</b>, after Maximilian Crowdy (served 1770-81), uncovered numerous planned attacks on Muggles by extremist Pure-blood groups, died in office (mysterious circumstances).</li>
<li><b>Gambol</b>, after Ottaline Gambol (served 1827-1835), established the Hogwarts Express.</li>
<li><b>Gamp</b>, after Ulick Gamp (served 1707-18), Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot and first-ever Minister for Magic.</li>
<li><b>Gore</b>, after Hephaestus Gore (served 1752-70), early Auror, suppressed numerous rebellions and civil disturbances by Non-human Beings.</li>
<li><b>Leach</b>, after Nobby Leach (served 1962-68), first-ever Muggle-born Minister for Magic.</li>
<li><b>Lufkin</b>, after Artemisia Lufkin (served 1798-1811), first-ever female Minister for Magic, established the Department of International Magical Cooperation, brought the Quidditch World Cup to Britain.</li>
<li><b>Rowle</b>, after Damocles Rowle (served 1718-26), established Azkaban Prison, was a noted anti-Muggle bigot.</li>
<li><b>Spavin</b>, after Faris Spavin (served 1865-1903), longest-serving Minister for Magic, quashed the most recent Goblin Rebellion, retired at the age of 147 at the suggestion of the Wizengamot.</li>
<li><b>Spencer-Moon</b>, after Leonard Spencer-Moon (served 1939-48), who presided over the war against Grindelwald. There is a (video game) character named Spencer Whiddon, but “Spencer” was adapted as a given name quite commonly in the Muggle World as well. Considering Xenophilius and Grindelwald's shared interest in the Deathly Hallows, perhaps Luna's name refers to Spencer-Moon.</li>
</ol><h1>Other Canonical Cases</h1><ol>
<li><b>Aurelius </b>saw use in the name of Aurelius Dumbledore (I don't love this one, but I wanted to have a list of ten).</li>
<li><b>Avery </b>saw use in the name of Avery Hawksworth.</li>
<li><b>Bones </b>saw use in the name of an albino bloodhound (in <em>Hogwarts Mystery</em>), which could suggest that Bones was used as a given name for some time before it became popular for animals.</li>
<li><b>Cole </b>saw use in the name of Cole Spencer.</li>
<li><b>Crookshank(s)</b> saw use in the name of Hermione's cat, which could suggest that Bones was used as a given name for some time before it became popular for animals.</li>
<li><b>Dunbar </b>saw use in the name of Dunbar Oglethorpe.</li>
<li><b>Hilliard </b>saw use in the name of Hilliard Hobday.</li>
<li><b>Idris </b>saw use in the name of Idris Oakby. It's worth noting that “Idris” is a given name already, but there was also a wizard by the name of Gwydion Idris in the early 19th century.</li>
<li><b>Sinistra </b>saw use in the name of Sinistra Lowe.</li>
<li><b>Urquhart </b>saw use in the name of Urquhart Rackharrow.</li>
</ol>
