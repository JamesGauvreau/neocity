    <p>“<a href="https://www.s-gabriel.org/names/arval/bynames/" rel="nofollow">A Brief Introduction to Medieval
            Bynames</a>,” by Brian M. Scott and Joshua Mittleman, describes bynames: non-hereditary surnames intended to
        distinguish a person from others with the same given name. It covers the four main types of byname, with
        examples of each.</p>

    <p>“<a href="https://www.s-gabriel.org/names/arval/bynames/scabynames.html#scabynames" rel="nofollow">The Difference
            Between Typical SCA Bynames and Medieval Bynames</a>,” by Brian M. Scott and Joshua Mittleman, describes
        common mistakes made by members of the Society of Creative Anachronism when making surnames for their SCA
        characters, which might also be made by HP fic writers.</p>

    <p>The 16th century saw the rise of virtue names and names from the Greek and Latin classics, as well as a trend of
        using surnames as given names (e.g. Neville). The Reference Guide currently has none of this, and while the
        names in this chapter saw use in Cornwall, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, the Reference Guide will eventually
        cover names that are particular to or especially common in each of those countries.</p>

    <p>Middle names did not really become common in Britain until the 18th century, after the Statute of Secrecy, which
        may be why so few wixes have interesting middle names. If there are religious wixes in your canon, then it also
        bears mentioning that children are sometimes christened under one name but use a different name in day-to-day
        life.</p>

    <p>Names in parentheses are Latin, and underlined diminutives and variants are attested in the <a
            href="https://dmnes.org/about" rel="nofollow">Dictionary of Medieval Names from European Sources</a>. To
        keep the lists from getting too long, if there are many similar spelling variations of a single name, I
        typically choose just one.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for even more names, then <a
            href="https://www.britishbabynames.com/blog/2012/08/top-200-most-popular-names-in-england-and-wales-1900.html">this
            list of baby names from 1900</a> is a good place to start. It
        includes several names that may be familiar to you, like Charles, Millicent, Myrtle, and Trevor.</p>

    <p>Smith-Bannister comments that the most significant aspect to how names were chosen during the 16th and 17th
        centuries was “the naming of children after their godparents.” This trend would decline after the Tudor period,
        shifting more to naming them after their parents. He adds “it may be possible to see this form of name-sharing
        as an extension of the act of forging a symbolic link between a child and his or her baptismal sponsor.”</p>


    <p>
        <strong>Guidelines for diminutive names: </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diminutives often begin by isolating the first syllable, e.g. Arthur → Art. Sometimes the name will be
            contracted in another way, e.g. Isabel → Ibb.</li>
        <li>Diminutives may be doubled up, e.g. Alice → Alot → Alotta, Isabel → Ibb → Ibbot, Mary → Mariet → Marrietta.
            This can be continued as far as you'd like, e.g. Isabel → Ibb → Ibbel → Ibelot. This often occurs as
            diminutives become accepted as given names in their own right, like how modern children may be named “Jim”
            instead of “James.”</li>
        <li>At the beginning of a name, “M” may be transformed into “P”, e.g. Mary → Molly → Polly, or Margaret → Megg →
            Pegg.</li>
        <li>Diminutive suffixes in use in Medieval England include “-el,” “-et,” “-etta,” “-kin” (e.g. Dudley →
            Duddikins), “-ot” or “-ota,” “-in”, “-s” (Elizabeth → Betts, William → Wills), “-sy” (e.g. Bettsy, Robsy),
            and “-y” (e.g. Adam → Addy).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Diminutive names often become names in their own right (e.g. Harry, Tom) or even produce new names, e.g. John →
        Jankin (Johnkin) → Jack.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Guidelines for other variants: </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names beginning with a vowel may start with “H,” e.g. Elisabeth → Helisabeth, Enoch → Henoch.</li>
        <li>Names beginning with “A” or “E” may often begin with the other vowel, e.g. Alice → Elice, Emeline → Ameline.
        </li>
        <li>Names beginning with “J-” may begin with “I-” or “Y-” instead, e.g. James → Yames, John → Iohn. This
            imitates the Latin practice.</li>
        <li>Names ending with “-y” or “-ey” can generally with “-ie” as well, e.g. Charley → Charlie, Henry → Henrie
        </li>
        <li>The letter “e” may be replaced with “y,” e.g. Charles → Charlys, James → Jamys.</li>
        <li>The letter “i” may be replaced with “y,” e.g. Annis → Annys, dColin → Colyn, William → Wylliam</li>
        <li>The letter “h” may be dropped in the middle of words, e.g. Johanna → Joanna, Johnathan → Jonathan, Nicholas
            → Nicolas.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Multiple guidelines may be applied to the same name, e.g. Nicholas → Nycolas, Willy → Wylle.</p>

            Victoria. The diminutive &ldquo;Albamin&rdquo; is unattested but a valid Medieval construction and might
            well be equated with the Latin <em>albumen</em>, &ldquo;white of an egg; whiteness,&rdquo; used since the
            late 16th century and since the 19th century also spelled <em>albumin</em>.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><strong>Antony </strong>(Antonius), of unknown meaning. Diminutives include Ant(-e, -on), Tone, and Tony.
            Spelling variants include Anthonie and Anthony, which received an &ldquo;h&rdquo; due to the popular

        </li>

    <p>In both Scotland and Ireland, there was a common naming scheme based on birth order and family relations:&nbsp;
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first son (or daughter) is named after his (or her) paternal grandfather (or maternal
            grandmother).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The second son (or daughter) is named after his (or her) maternal grandfather (or paternal
            grandmother).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The third son (or daughter) is named after his (or her) father (or mother).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Other sons (or daughters) are named after their uncles (or aunts).&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Middle names were not common until modern times, and were usually the (maiden) surname of either the maternal
        grandmother or the mother. Other middle names were sourced from friends, employers, landlords, et cetera, but
        were still most often surnames.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It was common to form a girl&rsquo;s name from a boy&rsquo;s name by adding the suffix <em>-ina</em>. Additional,
        minor alterations may also be made, e.g. Alexander is modified to <em>Alexandrina</em> more often than
        <em>Alexanderina</em>, and David is modified to <em>Davina</em> more often than Davidina. These names often get
        the diminutive &ldquo;Ina&rdquo; or &ldquo;Nina.&rdquo;&nbsp;

    <p>Both Cornwall and Wales were conquered by England well before the modern era, and unlike Ireland and Scotland
        their census data is often lumped in with England&rsquo;s. This can make it very difficult to determine naming
        trends in the past couple of centuries, and means that Cornish and Welsh names, whether original to those
        countries or variants of foreign names, are harder to find in good numbers than Irish and Scottish names.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>It was possible to form a good list of twenty Welsh names, but considerably harder for Cornwall. I don&rsquo;t
        want to present a bad list, but I also don&rsquo;t want to forget about Cornwall, so I&rsquo;ve combined the two
        lists.</p>
