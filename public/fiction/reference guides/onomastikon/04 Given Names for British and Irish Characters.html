    <p>“<a href="https://www.s-gabriel.org/names/arval/bynames/" rel="nofollow">A Brief Introduction to Medieval
            Bynames</a>,” by Brian M. Scott and Joshua Mittleman, describes bynames: non-hereditary surnames intended to
        distinguish a person from others with the same given name. It covers the four main types of byname, with
        examples of each.</p>

    <p>“<a href="https://www.s-gabriel.org/names/arval/bynames/scabynames.html#scabynames" rel="nofollow">The Difference
            Between Typical SCA Bynames and Medieval Bynames</a>,” by Brian M. Scott and Joshua Mittleman, describes
        common mistakes made by members of the Society of Creative Anachronism when making surnames for their SCA
        characters, which might also be made by HP fic writers.</p>

    <p>The 16th century saw the rise of virtue names and names from the Greek and Latin classics, as well as a trend of
        using surnames as given names (e.g. Neville). The Reference Guide currently has none of this, and while the
        names in this chapter saw use in Cornwall, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, the Reference Guide will eventually
        cover names that are particular to or especially common in each of those countries.</p>

    <p>Middle names did not really become common in Britain until the 18th century, after the Statute of Secrecy, which
        may be why so few wixes have interesting middle names. If there are religious wixes in your canon, then it also
        bears mentioning that children are sometimes christened under one name but use a different name in day-to-day
        life.</p>

    <p>Names in parentheses are Latin, and underlined diminutives and variants are attested in the <a
            href="https://dmnes.org/about" rel="nofollow">Dictionary of Medieval Names from European Sources</a>.</p>

    <p>To keep the lists from getting too long, if there are many similar spelling variations of a single name, I
        typically choose just one.</p>

    <p>If you're looking for even more names, then <a href="https://www.britishbabynames.com/blog/2012/08/top-200-most-popular-names-in-england-and-wales-1900.html">this list of baby names from 1900</a> is a good place to start. It
        includes several names that may be familiar to you, like Charles, Millicent, Myrtle, and Trevor.</p>

    <p>Smith-Bannister comments that the most significant aspect to how names were chosen during the 16th and 17th
        centuries was “the naming of children after their godparents.” This trend would decline after the Tudor period,
        shifting more to naming them after their parents. He adds “it may be possible to see this form of name-sharing
        as an extension of the act of forging a symbolic link between a child and his or her baptismal sponsor.”</p>


    <p>
        <strong>Guidelines for diminutive names: </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diminutives often begin by isolating the first syllable, e.g. Arthur → Art. Sometimes the name will be
            contracted in another way, e.g. Isabel → Ibb.</li>
        <li>Diminutives may be doubled up, e.g. Alice → Alot → Alotta, Isabel → Ibb → Ibbot, Mary → Mariet → Marrietta.
            This can be continued as far as you'd like, e.g. Isabel → Ibb → Ibbel → Ibelot. This often occurs as
            diminutives become accepted as given names in their own right, like how modern children may be named “Jim”
            instead of “James.”</li>
        <li>At the beginning of a name, “M” may be transformed into “P”, e.g. Mary → Molly → Polly, or Margaret → Megg →
            Pegg.</li>
        <li>Diminutive suffixes in use in Medieval England include “-el,” “-et,” “-etta,” “-kin” (e.g. Dudley →
            Duddikins), “-ot” or “-ota,” “-in”, “-s” (Elizabeth → Betts, William → Wills), “-sy” (e.g. Bettsy, Robsy),
            and “-y” (e.g. Adam → Addy).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Diminutive names often become names in their own right (e.g. Harry, Tom) or even produce new names, e.g. John →
        Jankin (Johnkin) → Jack.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Guidelines for other variants: </strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Names beginning with a vowel may start with “H,” e.g. Elisabeth → Helisabeth, Enoch → Henoch.</li>
        <li>Names beginning with “A” or “E” may often begin with the other vowel, e.g. Alice → Elice, Emeline → Ameline.
        </li>
        <li>Names beginning with “J-” may begin with “I-” or “Y-” instead, e.g. James → Yames, John → Iohn. This
            imitates the Latin practice.</li>
        <li>Names ending with “-y” or “-ey” can generally with “-ie” as well, e.g. Charley → Charlie, Henry → Henrie
        </li>
        <li>The letter “e” may be replaced with “y,” e.g. Charles → Charlys, James → Jamys.</li>
        <li>The letter “i” may be replaced with “y,” e.g. Annis → Annys, dColin → Colyn, William → Wylliam</li>
        <li>The letter “h” may be dropped in the middle of words, e.g. Johanna → Joanna, Johnathan → Jonathan, Nicholas
            → Nicolas.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Multiple guidelines may be applied to the same name, e.g. Nicholas → Nycolas, Willy → Wylle.</p>

        <li><strong>Hilda </strong>( — ), meaning “battle.” This is actually a diminutive of many names (Hildegard,
            Hildegilde, Hildetrude, and Sehild, among others) but became vastly more common than any of the longer forms
            from which it is derived, even in Latin name registers (therefore, the common Latin form of “Hilda” is
            <em>Hilda</em>). Consider these to be variants. For parents who want a more obviously Latin name, consider
            names such as Hildegardis, Hildegildis, and Hildetrudis, or perhaps Hildis (but note that this one is
            <em>not</em> attested).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Joan </strong>(Johanna), meaning “God is gracious.” Diminutives include Ionet, Janet, and Jennet.
            Variations include Ione, Jahne, Jean, Jehanne, Johnna, and Jone. Jane became a popular variant in the 17th
            century, so traditionalists may consider it a Muggle name.</li>
        <li><strong>Lettice </strong>(Leticia), meaning “joy, gladness, delight.” Diminutives include Lece(-l, -lina, or
            -ln), Lecia, Lecilina, Lete, Letsel(ina), Lesellyn, or Let(-e, -t, or -te). Other variants include Letitia,
            Lettes, Lettis, and Lettisse. “Lettuce” is assuredly <em>not</em> a historical variant, but let's be real,
            your readers will think you just misspelled that word anyway (and Merlin help you if Autocorrect is active).
            Name your next Dark witch “Lettuce Greengrass” or you're a coward (if you want to slip the Old English word
            for “lettuce” past them, use the name “Leactric,” or “Leaghtrick” or “Leaghtry” if you want to update it a
            little).</li>
        <li><strong>Margaret </strong>(Margeria), meaning “pearl.” Diminutives include Grete, Greta, Madge, Mag(ot),
            May, Meg(-gy or -ot), Mette, Mogg(e), and Pogg(e). Other variants include Margareta, Margarete, Margery,
            Margett, Marguerite, Mariory, Mergeret, and Margret.</li>
        <li><strong>Mary </strong>(Mariona), perhaps meaning “sea of bitterness,” or “rebelliousness,” or “wished-for
            child.” Diminutives include Mae, Mal(-le, -in, or -kin), Marion, Marriot(a). Marina, Marryat, May, Moll(-e
            or -y), and Polkin. Other variants include Mare, Maria, Marie and Miriam. It is sometimes considered a
            feminine version of Marius.</li>
        <li><strong>Matilda </strong>(Matildis), meaning “strength in battle.” Diminutives include Maddie, Mattie,
            Mette, Motte, Tillot, and Tilly. Other variants include Mald, Mawt, Mold, Mathilda, Matill, and Maud(e).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Mellany </strong>(Melania), meaning “blackness, darkness.” Diminutives include Mel(-antha, -ina, and
            -inda) and Mindy. Other variants include Melanie and Mellony.</li>
        <li><strong>Petronilla </strong>(Petronia), meaning “rustic, yokel, hick.” Diminutives include Pennel, Parnell,
            Peryna, and Purnell(a). Other variants include and Peternell, Petronelle, and Petronill. Commonly regarded
            as a feminine form of Peter/Petrus (meaning “rock, stone,” and hence the variant “Peternell”) but actually
            related to Petronius.</li>
        <li><strong>Sara </strong>(Sarre), meaning “princess.” Diminutives include Sadie, Sallie, Sarie, Sarina, Sarret,
            and Sarrot. Other variants include Sarah, which was rare in the Medieval period.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Other names include <strong>Dowsebell </strong>(Dulcibelle), from <em>dulcis</em>, “sweet, charming, pleasant,”
        and <em>bella</em>, “beautiful, agreeable, polite”; <strong>Gemma </strong>(Gemme), meaning “gem, precious
        stone,” and occasionally an English feminine form of “James”; <strong>Goldgift </strong>(Goldiva), meaning how
        it sounds and updated from Goldgifu, from <em>gold</em>, “gold,” and <em>gifu</em>, “gift”; <strong>Imberg
        </strong>(Ymberga), meaning “strong hill”; <strong>Sweetrune </strong>(Dulciruna), updated from Sweterun, from
        <em>swete</em>, “sweet, cute,” and <em>run</em>, “whisper; rune; mystery, secret; writing.”
