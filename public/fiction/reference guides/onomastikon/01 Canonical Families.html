    <hr>
    <p><a name="BackCat1" rel="nofollow" id="BackCat1"></a>This chapter will eventually address every surname of every
        witch or wizard of every degree of canon, from the books to the video games. There are more than fifteen hundred
        names, however, so I'm going to add names in piecemeal fashion, a few here and a few there. More than 300
        surnames are listed below, including (unless I missed someone) everyone mentioned in the books and the handful
        of names that showed up on Rowling's Classlist (like Tracey Davis) but didn't make it any further.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Brown</b>
        </p>

        <p>Extant in England, Ireland, and Scotland, and most common in Lancashire. Derived from the Old English <em>
                brūn </em> or Old French <em> brun</em>, both meaning “brown.” In Ireland and Scotland, an Anglicization
            of <em> Ó Duinn</em>, “brown-haired,” and in Ireland also an Anglicization of <em> Mac an Bhreitheamhnaigh
            </em> or <em> Brehany</em>, “son of the judge.”</p>

        <p>Diana Summers believes that <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2006/01/28/secrets-of-the-classlist/"
                rel="nofollow"> Lavender Brown comes from Sussex</a>, but Summers also feels that Lavender is actually a
            Muggle-born, so you can take it or leave it.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Bulstrode</b>
        </p>

        <p>Refer to <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/53410162/chapters/135298261" rel="nofollow">this guide's

                chapter on <em>The Sacred Twenty-eight</em></a>.</p>

            <b>Carrow</b>
        </p>

        <p>Refer to <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/53410162/chapters/135298261" rel="nofollow">this guide's
                chapter on <em>The Sacred Twenty-eight</em></a>.</p>

        <p>One member of the Carrow family served Grindelwald in the 1920s and 1930s. Alecto and Amycus Carrow were
            Death Eaters in both wars. Flora and Hestia Carrow were students at Hogwarts during the 1996-97 school year.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Cornfoot</b>
        </p>

        <p>Scottish surname, probably a variant of Cornforth or Cornford, derived from either <em> corn</em>, “grain,”
            or <em> cron</em>, “crane.” Probably a habitational name referring to the community of Cornforth in County
            Durham, and extant through Durham and North Yorkshire, as well as some parts of eastern Scotland.
            Best-attested in Fife, Scotland.</p>

        <p>It is worth noting that in 1704, an eastern Scottish woman named “Janet Cornfoot” was accused of being a
            witch. She was acquitted, but lynched and crushed to death — a method that could not have been prevented by
            the Flame-freezing Charm.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Crabbe</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably derived from the Middle English <em> crabbe </em> (Old English <em> crabba</em>), “crab,” perhaps in
            reference to a person's gait or, analogizing to a crab apple, to a sour temper. It may also refer to an
            occupation of catching and selling shellfish, either in England or Northern Europe (e.g. Middle Low German
            <em> krabbe</em>, Middle Dutch <em> crabbe</em>).</p>

        <p>The surname is most common in South West England, including Somerset, which is just west of Wiltshire, where
            Malfoy Manor is located.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Crouch</strong>

        <p>
            <b>Doge</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Farrell</b>
        </p>

        <p>Irish Anglicization of <em> Ó Fearghail</em>, from <em> fear</em>, “man,” and <em> gal</em>, “valor,
            courage.” Most common in County Longford, but well-attested elsewhere.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Fawley</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Gamp</b>
        </p>

        <p>Danish, Dutch, and German name, derived from <em> kamp</em>, “enclosed or fenced piece of land, field,” or
            from the German <em> kampe</em>, “warrior, combatant,” or from the Dutch <em> kanep</em>, “hemp.” Or, in
            London and Norfolk, an English variant of Camp, derived from the Middle English <em> kempe</em>, “warrior.”

        </p>

        <p>In Denmark, England, and North Germany, an occupational name for a maker of pots, whether made of clay,
            metal, or elsewhat. According to <a

                Pottermore/WW</a>, the British Potters are descended from the 12th century wizard Linfred of Stinchcombe

            aimless movement in his garden, and whose herbal and medicinal experiments “laid the foundation of the
            Potter family's fortune.”</p>

        <p>
            <b>Tripe</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English name Tripp, derived from the Middle English <em> trippen </em> (Old French <em>
                triper</em>), “to dance; to stumble,” perhaps referring to a dancer or to someone who had trouble
            walking.</p>

        <p>Magenta Tripe was a Pure-blood.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Urquart; Urquhart</b>
        </p>

        <p>Scottish name referring to various communities in Scotland, especially the barony of Urquhart, derived from
            the Pictish <em> ar</em>, “on, by,” and <em> carden</em>, “enclosure; wood, copse.” Most common in Ross and
            Cromarty, and also well-attested in Fife and Moray.</p>

        <p>Elphinstone Urquart was a Pure-blood wizard who died in 1985, following a brief marriage to Minerva
            McGonagall. The 1996-97 Slytherin Quidditch team captain was named Urquhart. One of these may be a
            misspelling.</p>

    <p>These families are not specifically described as being Pure-blooded in the 20th century, and may have
        intermarried with Muggles or Half-bloods too recently to technically qualify as Pure-bloods, but nevertheless
        appear to have deep roots in the magical community.</p>

        <summary>Names A-M</summary>

        <p>
            <b>Batworthy</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name, probably referring to the Devon community of Batworthy, formerly Badworthy, <em> worthy </em>
            meaning “enclosed homestead,” from Bada's wordig, or the homestead belonging to Bada. The spelling
            “Batworthy” is attested by the late 18th century.</p>

        <p>Podric Batworthy lived somewhen after the 14th century, which we know because he received the Order of
            Merlin. Podric Batworthy XXIII owned a barbershop in the Alleys.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Belby</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English name Bielby, referring to the communities of Bielby or Belby in East Yorkshire, or
            Bilby in Nothinghamshire, derived form the Old Norse personal names <em> Beli </em> or <em> Bili </em> and
            the Old Norse <em> by</em>, “farmstead, settlement.”</p>

        <p>Flavius Belby survived a Lethifold attack in the 18th century. Damocles Belby invented the Wolfsbane Potion
            probably around the 1980s. Marcus Belby was his nephew and attended Hogwarts in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Bell</b>
        </p>

        <p>Attested in northern England and the Scottish lowlands. May be derived from the Middle English <em> belle
            </em> (Old English <em> belle</em>), “bell,” referring to a bell ringer or bell maker, or someone who lives
            near a bell or in a bell tower. In Scotland, may also be a variant of Mac Giolla Mhaoil, “son of the servant
            of the devotee.”</p>

        <p>Cassius Bell joined Grindelwald in the 1920s. A scantily-named wizard named “Bell” co-owned Cogg and Bell
            Clockmakers in Carkett Market. Katie Bell attended Hogwarts in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Bones</b>
        </p>

        <p>As an English name, may be derived from the Middle English <em> bon(e) </em> (Old French <em> bon</em>),
            “good”; or from the Middle English <em> bone </em> (Old English <em> bān</em>), “thin, bony; leg,” perhaps
            referring to long legs or a bad leg; or be a variant of the Anglo-Norman <em> boone</em>, referring to
            Bohon, in France. May be derived from the Hungarian <em> bóné</em>, “fishing net,” referring to a fisher or
            a net-maker. May be an Anglicization of the Irish <em> Ó Cnáimhsighe</em>, from <em> cnámh</em>, “bone.” May
            be derived from the Norwegian <em> Bones</em>, referring to a farm in Trøndelag and derived from the name of
            the river Bua and the word <em> nes</em>, “promontory, headland”; or from the Norwegian <em> Bønes</em>,
            referring to a farm in Hordaland. FamilySearch suggests that the name can also be derived from <em>
                Bone</em>, a Yiddish female personal name. The name is most common in Essex.</p>

        <p>Not necessarily Pure-bloods, but certainly an established magical family. Edgar and Amelia were both wixes,
            and multiple Muggle-borns in one family are rare, so they had at least one magical parent themselves, and if
            we accept the extended canon then there's an Effie Bones in the 1890s and a Seraphina Bones somewhen in
            history. Susan herself is a Half-blood on Rowling's classlist.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Boot</b>
        </p>

        <p>In English, derived from Old French <em> bote</em>, referring to a maker or seller or boots. In Dutch and
            German, may be derived from <em> bode</em>, “envoy, messenger,” referring to a messenger or representative;
            or from <em> boot</em>, “boat,” referring to a boatman. The sense of “envoy, messenger,” also exists in
            English, from the Old English <em> boda</em>, but seems to be less common. The name may also refer to the
            community of Boot, in Cumbria, though the name is most common in Nottinghamshire.</p>

        <p>Albert Boot was Minister for Magic from 1747 to 1752, so the Boots have been a magical family since the 18th
            century at least. On the other hand, “Trevor Boot” is a Muggle-born on Rowling's classlist, so perhaps
            they're unrelated, Boot is the child of a Squib, or Rowling changed her mind about more than just
            Trevor's/Terry's given name.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Cooper</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to a maker and repairer of wooden vessels, from the Middle English <em> couper</em>.
            May also be an anglicization of the Ashkenazic Jewish names Kupfer and Kupper, from the Yiddish <em>
                kuper</em>, “copper,” referring to someone who mined, worked with, or traded in copper. Most common in
            Lancashire, but well-represented across England.</p>

        <p>Isaac Cooper attended Hogwarts in the 1890s. Buckley Cooper wrote a letter to the <em> Daily Prophet </em> in
            1999, and had a brother at that time, so they probably had at least one magical parent. Buckley Cooper's
            brother had children, whom Buckley wanted to transform into “vampire ferrets.” Hortense Cooper was a student
            during the 1996-97 school year.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Davies</b>
        </p>

        <p>Welsh and English variant of Davis, which is derived from the patronym ap Dafydd, “Dafydd's son.” May also
            refer to the Medieval Welsh kingdom of Dyfed in Carmarthenshire. One of the most common surnames in Wales.
            Pronounced the same as “Davis.”</p>

        <p>Lawrence Davies attended Hogwarts in the late 19th century. Chester Davies attended Hogwarts from 1980 to
            1987. Roger Davies attended Hogwarts from 1989 to 1996.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Diggory</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English personal name Diggory, possibly derived from the protagonist of
            the Medieval romance <em> Sir Degarre</em>.</p>

        <p>Eldritch Diggory was elected Minister for Magic in 1733 and again in 1740. In the 1990s, Amos Diggory worked
            for the Ministry of Magic and his son Cedric attended Hogwarts.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Egwu</b>
        </p>

        <p>Egwu may mean “fear” or “fear of God.” It is Nigerian, and not well-attested in the U.K.</p>

        <p>Andre Egwu attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991. His parents were Magizoologists, and his grandmother
            (maternal or paternal) used to play Quidditch for Pride of Portree. His cousin, Jules Egwu, was homeschooled
            rather than sent to Hogwarts. Andre also had a sister.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Flack</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English <em> flak</em>, “sod, turf, block of peat,” perhaps referring to
            the occupation of turf cutter. May also be a variant of the English and Scottish name Fleck, most common in
            Northumberland and derived from <em> flecked</em>, “pied, spotted,” perhaps describing a freckled person.
        </p>

        <p>Basil Flack was Minister for Magic in 1752, and only 1752. Christopher Flack was a student at Hogwarts during
            the 1993-94 school year.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Fletcher</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English <em> fleccher </em> (Old French <em> flechier</em>), “fletcher,”
            referring to someone who made or sold arrows for bows.</p>

        <p>Phineas Fletcher was a trafficker in banned goods in the 15th century, and his descendant Mundungus Fletcher
            kept up the tradition of knavery in the 20th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Fortescue</b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglo-Norman nickname derived from the Old French <em> fort</em>, “strong,” and <em> escu</em>, “shield.” A
            landholding family of this name was recorded in Devon in 1086.</p>

        <p>Besides the ice cream guy, there was a Headmaster at Hogwarts named Dexter Fortescue.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Goldstein</b>
        </p>

        <p>Ashkenazi Jewish name, derived from the German <em> Gold</em>, “gold,” and <em> stein</em>, “stone,” and most
            common in and around London.</p>

        <p>If we accept the extended canon then there are wixen members of the Goldstein family in both the U.K. and
            U.S. They're all Half-bloods, but that's still suggestive of a magical family history.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Hawksworth</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to one of two communities called Hawksworth, in Yorkshire (derived from the Old
            English personal name <em> Hafoc </em> and <em> worth</em>, “enclosure”) and Nottinghamshire (derived from
            the Old English personal name <em> Hoc </em> and <em> worth</em>, “enclosure”), and in either case
            influenced by the Middle English <em> hauk</em>, “hawk.”</p>

        <p>Cillian Hawksworth was a wizard in the late 19th century. Avery Hawksworth played on the English National
            Quidditch team in 1994.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Moon, Spencer-Moon </b>
        </p>

        <p>Connacht variant of the Irish <em> Mohan</em>, an Anglicization of <em> Ó Mocháin</em>, descendant of Mochán,
            a diminutive of <em> moch</em>, “early, timely.” Anglo-Norman name referring to the community of Moyon, in
            Normandy. Could also just refer to the goddamn sky orb.</p>

        <p>Gladwin Moon was caretaker at Hogwarts in the late 19th century. Lily Moon was a Hogwarts student in 1991, if
            we use Rowling's classlist. Dennis Moon played Quidditch for the New Zealand National Quidditch team in
            2014. Leonard Spencer-Moon, who was Minister for Magic from 1939 to 1948, is plausibly related.</p>

        <summary>Names N-Z</summary>

        <p>
            <b>Parkin</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name, most common in Yorkshire, derived from the Middle English name Parkin, a diminutive derived
            from the name Peter, meaning “stone.”</p>

        <p>Walter Parkin was a wizarding butcher in the 15th century, and his seven children were the founding members
            of the Wigtown Wanderers. The family were alive and well, and still playing Quidditch, in the 1990s: Ethan
            Parkin played Chaser for the Wigtown Wanderers and his daughter Skye Parkin played Chaser at Hogwarts and
            again for the Wigtown Wanderers sometime after graduation. Skye Parkin's cousin played Quidditch with her.
            Blythe Parkin, who may be this cousin, played for the English National Quidditch team.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Peakes</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name, most common in Yorkshire, probably a variant of the English name Picker, referring to someone
            who worked with a pick or pickaxe.</p>

        <p>Sean Peakes was a student at Hogwarts during the 1993-94 school year, the 1996-97 school year, and presumably
            others as well. Jimmy Peakes attended Hogwarts from 1994 to 2001. They could be related. Glanmore Peakes
            lived in the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Peasegood</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English nickname Peasegood, derived from the Middle English <em> pese </em> (Old English <em>
                peose</em>), “pea,” and <em> codd</em>, “bag,” i.e. “pea pod,” referring to something of little worth.
            May have referred to someone considered to have little value, or to a grower or seller of peas.</p>

        <p>The 18th century inventor of Quodpot was a Peasegood, as was an Obliviator and Hit Wizard in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Rookwood</b>
        </p>

        <p>Refers to various communities in Essex and Sussex named Rookwood, derived from the Middle English <em>
                rok</em>, “rook,” and <em> wood</em>, “wod.”</p>

        <p>There have been Rookwoods in Magical Britain since the 15th century, if not earlier, if the <em> Hogwarts
                Legacy </em> game is accepted as canon. Elsewise, we can at least assume that Rookwood was a Half-blood,
            if not a Pure-blood, because he was a Death Eater, though in this case we have no idea whether the surname
            itself is a magical surname.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Runcorn</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably refers to the town of Runcorn in Cheshire, which is derived from the Old English <em> rúm</em>,
            “wide, broad,” and <em> cofa</em>, “cave, cove.” In different editions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle the town
            has been called <em> Rumcofan </em> and <em> Runkhorn</em>, and I can't pin down the date of the latter use,
            so perhaps Runcorn predates the Norman Conquest and perhaps. The name is most common in Cheshire and
            Lancashire.</p>

        <p>Due to Albert Runcorn's position in the Occupied Ministry and the respect which he seemed to hold there, I
            think that the Runcorns are Pure-bloods. There was also a Runcorn (given name, house, and blood status
            unknown) on Rowling's classlist.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Sallow</b>
        </p>

        <p>English — primarily West Yorkshire — name derived from the Middle English <em> swalu</em>, “swallow,”
            referring to the bird, perhaps due to swiftness and grace. May also refer to the community of Swallow in
            Lincolnshire, of unclear etymology.</p>

        <p>There were Sallows in the 19th, 20th, and 21st centuries.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Scrimgeour</b>
        </p>

        <p>Scottish variant of the Middle English <em> skirmesour </em> (Old French <em> escremisseor</em>), “fencing
            master.”</p>

        <p>Brutus Scrimgeor was a headmaster of Hogwarts, so the family has been magic since before the 20th century.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Shah</b>
        </p>

        <p>Either an Indian name derived from the Gujarati <em> sah</em>, “merchant,” or a name attested from Iran to
            Bangladesh, derived from the Persian <em> shah</em>, “king.”</p>

        <p>Satyavati Shah taught Astronomy at Hogwarts in the late 19th century. Her sister was a Squib, indicating that
            they had magical parents. Poonima Shah was a Slytherin student at Hogwarts during the 1993-94 school year.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Sharp</b>
        </p>

        <p>English and Scottish name derived from the Middle English <em> sharp </em> (Old English <em> scearp</em>),
            “sharp, quick, smart, acute, keen-witted.” Also an Anglicization of the Irish <em> Ó Géaráin</em>,
            descendant of Géaráin, a diminutive of géar, “sharp.”</p>

        <p>There were Sharps in the late 19th century, and the sisters Kitty and Scarlet Sharp went missing in 1997.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Snyde</b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglicization of the German and Ashkenazic Jewish name <em> Schneider</em>, meaning “tailor.”</p>

        <p>The Snydes have searched for the Sword of Gryffindor for centuries, so they've been around for a while.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Sykes</strong>
        </p>

        <p>English name, most common in Lancashire and Yorkshire, derived from the Middle English <em> sik</em>,
            “stream, ditch,” referring to someone who lived near a small watercourse, especially one that flowed through
            flat or marshy ground.</p>

        <p>Jocunda Sykes flew across the Atlantic Ocean on a broomstick in 1935. Alex Sykes was a prefect by 1993.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Trelawney</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the Cornish <em> Trelawny</em>, referring to the community of Trelawny and Trelawne manor in
            Cornwall. The name means “elm-tree homestead.” The Trelawneys may be connected to the Trelawny baronetcy,
            created in 1628.</p>

        <p>Sybil Trelawney is a Half-blood (her mother is a Muggle), but her great-great-grandmother, Cassandra
            Trelawney, was a Seer of no small reputation, so the name has been circulating in Magical Britain for some
            time.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Tugwood</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English nickname <em> Toogood</em>, meaning “too good” and presumably meant in jest.</p>

        <p>Sacharissa Tugwood invented several beauty potions and lived from 1874 to 1966. Felicitania Tugwood was
            involved in a broom accident in 1992.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Wilkins, Wilkinson</b>
        </p>

        <p>West Midlands and southern English variant of the given name Wilkin, a diminutive of William introduced to
            England and Scotland following the Norman Conquest; or a Dutch and North German variant of Wilkens, a
            variant of Wilken, a diminutive of Wilhem. Wilkinson is a patronymic form of Wilkins.</p>

        <p>Heliotrope Wilkins was a Headmistress of Hogwarts in the COS film, and Ella Wilkins was a student in 1993 in
            the POA video game. If there is a Wilkins family, then they've probably been around for a while.</p>

        <p>Charity Wilkinson was the third president of MACUSA, and Saranna Wilkinson was a MACUSA Auror in the 2010s,
            but the only suggestion of a magical Wilkinson in Britain is a random notebook in a traveling exhibition.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Wood</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to someone who lived in or by a wood, from the Middle English <em> wode </em> (Old
            English <em> wudu</em>), “wood.” May also be a nickname for an eccentric or violent person, from the Middle

        </p>

        <p>English name referring to Binns in South Owram, or High Binns in Oxenhope, about which I've been able to find
            very little. They're in Yorkshire, if that helps! Probably derived from the Middle English <em> binn</em>,
            “stall, banger.”</p>

        <p>Cuthbert Binns died in the 19th century.</p>

        <p>

        </p>

                Blitha </em> and the Old English <em> worth</em>, “enclosure.” May also refer to a lost placename in

            <b>Byrne </b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglicization of the Irish <em> Ó Broin</em>, descendant of Bran, meaning “raven,” or of the Irish <em> Ó
                Birn</em>, descendant of Biorn, derived from the Old Norse <em> Bjorn</em>, meaning “bear.” Or, a
            variant of the English Berne, derived from the Middle English name Bern, which may be derived either from
            the Old Norse <em> Bjorn </em> or the Middle English <em> barn</em>, “child,” possibly referring to a young
            man from a prominent family; or the English name Burn, referring to someone who lived beside a stream (or in
            a place named after a stream), and derived from the Middle English <em> bourne </em> (Old English <em>
                burne</em>), “spring, stream.”</p>

        <p>Herodiana Byrne lived no later than the 19th century, and probably well before.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Cephalopos</b>
        </p>

        <p>Presumably derived from the Greek <em> kephale</em>, “head,” and <em> pous</em>, “foot, leg,” a singular form
            of <em> podos </em> (from which we get “cephalopod”). Not attested in Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Arturo Cephalopos was a 19th century wandmaker.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Creaseworthy</b>
        </p>

        <p>“Crease” may be derived from the Old English <em> creas</em>, “fine, elegant,” or from the Middle English
            <em> creste</em>, “ridge, crest,” and may be a surname in itself. “Worthy” is almost certainly derived the
            Middle English <em> worthi</em>, “enclosure.” The full meaning may therefore be something along the lines of
            “Crease's enclosure” or “the enclosure on (or by) the ridge.”</p>

        <p>Antonia Creaseworthy was Headmistress at Hogwarts sometime in the 17th and/or 18th centuries.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Crookshank, Cruickshank</b>

        <p>Scottish name derived from the Scots <em> cruik</em>, “(something) bent,” and <em> sceanca</em>, “shank,
            leg.” The older form of the two is “Cruickshank.”</p>

        <p>Poderick Cruickshank was born in 1492 and his portrait was painted in 1527. Poderick Crookshank was born in
            1532 and his portrait was painted in 1568.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Darker</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to the occupation of dyer, derived from the Middle English <em> derker</em>, “one who
            darkens things.”</p>

        <p>Dan Darker attended Hogwarts in the 18th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Derwent</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English Darwent, referring to the communities of Derwent (Derbyshire) and Darwen (Lancashire),
            both named after rivers called Derwent, ultimately derived from the Celtic <em> dwr-gent</em>, “clear
            water.” Various other rivers in Cumberland, Durham, Northumberland, and Yorkshire are also named Derwent.
        </p>

        <p>Dilys Derwent was an 18th century witch, and later the Headmistress of Hogwarts. I personally assume that
            Hogwarts hasn't had a Muggle-born Headteacher as of the 1990s (partly due to prejudice and partly because
            there just aren't many Muggle-borns in the first place), but even if we set that aside (which we ought to,
            because that's only my personal canon), there's also a 20th century wizard named Derwent Shimpling. It's not
            uncommon for surnames to transform into given names, and this suggests that Derwent circulated through
            Magical Britain at least long enough for Shimpling to be named after a (maternal?) relative of the Derwent
            family.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Everard </b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglo-Norman variant of Everett, and from the Middle English name <em> Everard</em>, derived from the
            Germanic <em> eber</em>, “wild board,” and <em> hard</em>, “brave, hardy, strong.” In some cases might have
            been derived instead from the Old English name <em> Eoforheard</em>, with the same meaning.</p>

        <p>Professor Everard was Headmaster of Hogwarts before the 20th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Filhous</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English name Milhouse, attested in Lancashire and Lincolnshire and referring to the occupation
            of miller, or someone else who might live at a “mill house.”</p>

        <p>Limus Filhous wrote for <em> The Daily Prophet </em> in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Fitzgerald</b>
        </p>

        <p>Irish name derived from the Norman <em> fitz</em>, “son,” and the personal name Gerald, i.e. “son of Gerald.”
            Fairly common in Ireland, and also Gailicized as “Mac Gearailt.” Many Fitzgeralds are descended from the
            12th century constable of Pembroke Castle, Gerald Fitzwalter de Windsor, and his grandson Raymond
            Fitzgerald. Also takes the form “FitzGerald.”</p>

        <p>Niamh Fitzegerald was Headmistress at Hogwarts in the late 15th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Gagwilde</b>
        </p>

        <p>Not attested in Muggle records, but possibly a combination of two other names. The first component may be
            derived from the English surname Gag, derived from the Middle English <em> gage </em> (Old French <em>
                gauge</em>), “fixed measure,” or from the Middle English (and Old French) <em> gage</em>, “pledge,
            surety,” referring in the latter case to a moneylender, or a variant of the Cornish name Geach, which may be
            derived from the Middle English <em> geche</em>, “simple.” The second component may be a variant of Wild,
            found in both England and Ireland.</p>

        <p>Brian Gagwilde was Headmaster at Hogwarts sometime prior to the 20th century. Brian Gagwilde III was his
            descendant, whose birth and death dates are unknown.</p>

        <p>

            <b>Hobhouse</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name possibly referring to the farmstead of Hobhouse in Devon, or to other hypothetical locations by
            that name, roughly meaning “goblin house,” being derived from the Middle English <em> hobbe</em>, “goblin.”
            “House” may also be derived from <em> hyrst</em>, “hillock, hurst, wood, forested eminence,” as in <em>
                Hobbe Hyrst</em>. In the 18th century there was a family of West Country / Somerset merchants by the
            name of Hobhouse, who also engaged in the slave trade, intermarried with the local gentry, and achieved
            success in both local and national politics. A collection of 15th century correspondence called the Paston
            Letters contains the enigmatic statement, “and this is in the name of Master Hobbe Hurst, Robin Goodfellow's
            brother he is, as I believe” (updated to modern vernacular).</p>

        <p>Duncan Hobhouse attended Hogwarts in the 19th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Idris</b>
        </p>

        <p>In Wales, the name is derived from <em> udd</em>, “lord, prince,” and <em> ris</em>, “ardent, enthusiastic,
            impulsive,” and can be seen in names such as Cadair Idris, “Idris' Chair,” and Idris Gawr, “Idris the
            Giant.” This is also an Arabic name, meaning “interpreter.”</p>

        <p>Gwydion Idris attended Hogwarts in the early 19th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Jackdaw</b>
        </p>

        <p>Exceedingly rare name, probably originating from Tayside in Scotland. Almost certainly refers to the species
            of crow called jackdaws, but the exact reason is unclear.</p>

        <p>Richard Jackdaw attended Hogwarts in the 18th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Jag</b>
        </p>

        <p>Rare variant of the English Tagg, most common in Nottinghamshire, and most likely derived from the Old
            English <em> tacca</em>, “lamb, young sheep.”</p>

        <p>Ernesto Jag sold veterinary supplies in the 19th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Jewkes </b>
        </p>

        <p>English name in Worcestershire, derived from a diminutive of the name <em> Jukel </em> or <em> Jokel</em>,
            derived from the Breton <em> Judicael</em>, from <em> iuth</em>, “lord,” and <em> hael</em>, “generous,
            bountiful.” Most common in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, and introduced during the Norman Conquest.</p>

        <p>It's unclear when Leonard Jewkes lived, but he invented the Silver Arrow flying broomstick, which was
            eventually superseded by by the Cleansweep series of brooms, and the Cleansweep Broom Company wasn't founded
            until 1926.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Knightley</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Marchbanks </b>
        </p>

        <p>Scottish variant of Marjoribanks, purportedly (but perhaps erroneously) referring to the area of Marjoribanks
            in Dumfriesshire.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Otherhaus</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably of German origin, but it's unclear why the German <em> oter</em>, “otter,” would be anglicized (into
            “other,” as has happened in the past) but the German <em> haus</em>, “house,” has remained German. “Haus”
            alone is a valid German name, so perhaps there were two families (or two branches of one family) in Britain
            named Haus, and the less prominent were dubbed the Other Hauses. Not attested in Muggle records.</p>

            <b>Ronen</b>
        </p>

        <p>Jewish name derived from the Hebrew <em> ron</em>, “song, joy.”</p>

        <p>Abraham Ronen taught Charms at Hogwarts in the late 19th century. His father homeschooled him rather than
            send him to Hogwarts.</p>

        <p>Suffolk variant of the English name Spurr, derived from the Middle English <em> spore </em> (Old English <em>
                spora</em>), “spur,” perhaps referring to someone who made, sold, or wore spurs.</p>

        <p>Phyllida Spore was Headmistress of Hogwarts in the 15th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Swoopstikes</b>
        </p>

        <p>Evidently composed of the English <em> swoop</em>, “to fly or glide downwards suddenly; to move swiftly; to
            seize while on the wing; to sweep,” and the English <em> stike</em>, “stanza.” Not attested in Muggle
            records.</p>

        <p>Someone by the name of Swoopstikes taught Potions at Hogwarts at some point before the 20th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Treadwell</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English <em> tred</em>, “tread, walk, trample,” and <em> wel</em>,
            “well,” perhaps in reference to a fuller or to someone who trampled grapes to make wine.</p>

        <p>Nora and Priya Treadwell were witches in the late 19th century. We know nothing about their blood status.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Trimble </b>
        </p>

        <p>English and Irish variant of Trumble, which can be either a Middle English given name derived from the Old
            English <em> trum</em>, “strong,” and <em> beald</em>, “brave,” or a Norman Scottish name referring to Le
            Tremblay in Maine-et-Loire. In England, most common in the northwest, and in Ireland, most common in
            northern Ireland.</p>

        <p>Quentin Trimble was Headmaster of Hogwarts before the 20th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Umfraville </b>
        </p>

        <p>Norman English name referring to the communities of Umfreville or Offranville in France.</p>

        <p>The Norman Umfravilles held land in both England and Scotland. QUintius Umfraville lived in the 17th century.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Undercliffe</b>
        </p>

        <p>The English name Cliff or Cliffe generally refers to various communities of that name. The Old English <em>
                clif </em> means not just “vertical rock face” or “crag” but may also refer to slopes, even gentle
            hills. In the form “Undercliffe,” not attested in Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Fytherley Undercliffe was Headmaster at Hogwarts in the 16th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Vablatsky</b>
        </p>

        <p>Not attested in Muggle records. Out of universe, probably a riff on the so-called psychic Helena Blavatsky.
        </p>

        <p>Cassandra Vablatsky was a Seer who lived from 1894 to 1997.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Viridian</b>
        </p>

        <p>In English, <em> viridian </em> is a bluish-green color; the word is derived from the Latin <em>
                viridis</em>, “green.” Not attested in Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Vindictus Viridian was Headmaster at Hogwarts in the early 18th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Wellbeloved</b>
        </p>

        <p>English nickname derived from the Middle English <em> wel</em>, “well, very,” and <em> biloued</em>,
            “beloved.” Attested as early as 1259 in the form “Welbilove.”</p>

        <p>Dorcas Wellbeloved lived in the 19th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Wildsmith </b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English <em> Willesmogh</em>, “Will's son-in-law,” or derived from the
            Middle English <em> welsmith</em>, “wheel-smith,” referring to such an occupation.</p>

        <p>Ignatia Wildsmith inented Floo powder in the 13th or 14th centuries.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Withers</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English name Wither, either derived from the Middle English given name Wither, whose meaning
            is unknown but may be “warrior,” or “willow,” or “withstand,” or “wood,” or derived from the Middle English
            <em> withi </em> (Old English <em> withig</em>), “willow,” referring to someone who lived near a willow
            tree.</p>

        <p>Stoddard Withers lived from 1642 to 1769.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Youdle</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English name Yewdall, derived from the Anglo-Saxon <em> iw</em>, “yew tree,” and <em>
                dal</em>, “valley.”</p>

        <p>Cyprian Youdle, who came from Norfolk, was a Quidditch referee in the 14th century.</p>

        <summary>Names A-M</summary>

        <p>
            <b>Amorim, Amorinus</b>
        </p>

        <p>Portuguese name referring to various locations named Amorim, after the name of an estate owner named Amorini,
            possibly derived from <em> amorino</em>, “a cupid.” <em> Amorinus </em> is not attested but is plausibly a
            Latinization of <em> Amorim</em>.</p>

        <p>In the films there is an “R. Amorim” who wrote for the <em> Daily Prophet </em> as security editor and a
            “Rose Armorim” who wrote (or edited an edition of) <em> Spellman's Syllabary</em>. These are probably the
            same person. N. Amorinus wrote for the <em> New York Ghost </em> in the 1920s. I think that these names are
            plausibly connected, with “Amorinus” representing a Latinization.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Babbling</b>
        </p>

        <p>Perhaps refers to the Nottinghamshire hamlet of Babbington, or literally refers to the act of babbling, from
            the Middle English <em> bablyng</em>. Not attested in Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Bathsheda Babbling taught Study of Ancient Runes at Hogwarts in the 1990s, and possibly elsewhen.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Bagman</b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglicization of the Dutch name <em> Beekman</em>, referring to someone who lived by a creek or stream, i.e.
            <em> beek</em>. In England, <em> bagman </em>has since at least 1808 been a term for a traveling salesman.
        </p>

        <p>Ludo Bagman and his brother were magical, and their father was a friend of Augustus Rookwood, and probably
            not a Muggle-born.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Bagshot</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of Baggot, which is a variant of Baggett, which is a Norman name derived from the given name <em>
                Bagot</em>, a diminutive of the Germanic <em> Bago</em>, from <em> bag</em>, “to fight.” May also refer
            to the community of Bagshot in Surrey.</p>

        <p>Besides Bathilda Bagshot, there is an unspecified “Bagshot” on the Marauder's Map in the film version of POA.
            Because Grindelwald is Bathilda's great-nephew, Bathilda had at least one sibling, who was probably magical,
            and they had magical children, and so forth, so Bagshot was at least a Half-blood and there are probably
            several generations of Bagshots running around, and possibly a few more in the grave.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Blishwick</b>
        </p>

        <p>It seems that there are no Muggles by this name (I've found examples in Geneanet, but they're a consequence
            of multiple somebodies adding the Black Family Tree to that database, with no less than twenty Jimbo
            Blishwicks married to Misapinoa Black). “Blish” is a rare variant of the English surname Bliss, which may be
            derived from the Middle English <em> blisse</em>, “joy,” or be a Norman name referring to the French
            community of Blay (or Bleis). There is also a Worcestershire community called Stoke Bliss. The ending <em>
                -wick </em> is probably derived from the Middle English <em> wik</em>, “building, enclosed piece of
            land,” used to denote places associated with food production (e.g. Butterwick, “butter wick,” or Shapwick,
            “sheep wick”).</p>

        <p>Jimbo Blishwick married Misapinoa Black in the 19th century, so he was presumably a Pure-blood.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Bobbin</b>
        </p>

        <p>FamilySearch identifies this as an English and Scottish surname but says that the meaning is unexplained. A
            “bobbin” is a tool used in knitting, spinning, weaving, etc. The overwhelming majority of Bobbins on
            Geneanet are from East Anglia.</p>

        <p>Melinda Bobbin was a student at Hogwarts in 1996. Her family owned a large chain of apothecaries.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Chang</b>
        </p>

        <p>The Changs are generally assumed to be Chinese, in part because Cho Chang's actress in the films was Chinese.
            The Harry Potter wiki claims that Yuko Matsuoka (translator for the Japanese language edition of the series)
            says that Rowling told her that she “considered Cho Chang to be of Korean descent.” The wiki cites <a
                href="https://bookmeter.com/books/315919" rel="nofollow"> ハリー・ポッターと私に舞い降りた奇跡 </a> (which Google
            Translate renders as “The miracle that befell Harry Potter and me”), which I don't have and couldn't read if
            I had it. If anyone has a copy and can tell me more, I'd appreciate it.</p>

        <p>In her article “<a href="https://www.mugglenet.com/2021/05/korean-american-glimpses-in-harry-potter/"
                rel="nofollow"> Korean American Glimpses in ‘Harry Potter'</a>,” Lorrie Kim suggests that “Cho” may be
            short for “Cho-hyun.”</p>

        <p>In the films, Cho Chang's paternal grandfather was an Auror in 1927, and her mother worked for the Ministry.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Crane</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English <em> cran</em>, “crane,” referring to a tall, thin man with long
            legs or someone whose occupation involved cranes. May also be an anglicization of the Dutch <em> krane</em>,
            “crane.”</p>

        <p>Lucy and Walter Crane (siblings, not spouses) wrote and translated, and illustrated, children's stories
            together. Lucy was a Muggle, and Walter was a Muggle-born. Lindarina Crane, who may be descended from
            Walter, attended Hogwarts from 1988 to 1995.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Dunn; Dunne</b>
        </p>

        <p>May be an anglicization of the Irish name O Duinn, “descendant of Donn,” meaning “brown-haired” or
            “chieftain.” May be derived from the Middle English dun (Old English dunn, “dull brown”), “dun, dark.” May
            be a Scottish name referring to the Angus location of Dun, from the Gaelic <em> dun</em>, “fort.”</p>

        <p>“Dunne” may be a variant of any of these.</p>

        <p>Elora Dunn started at Hogwarts in 1988. Craig Dunn attended Hogwarts in the 1990s. They are probably siblings
            or at least cousins, suggesting that they have a magical relative in common.</p>

        <p>Crispin Dunne was a shopkeeper in the 19th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Fenwick; Finwick</b>
        </p>

        <p>Scottish and northern English name referring to one of two Northumberland communities or a Yorkshire
            community, all name “Fenwick,” from the Old English <em> fenn</em>, “marsh, fen,” and <em> wic</em>,
            “outlying dary farm.” In Scotland may also refer to the community of Ayrshire, as attested by various
            figures named Fynwyk or Fynvyk in the 14th and 15h centuries. Ultimately of English origin.</p>

        <p>“Finwick” is a variant thereof, found wherever the original may be found.</p>

        <p>Benjy Fenwick fought Voldemort during the First War and was murdered in 1981. In the 1990s, Mervin Fenwick
            played Quidditch for the Tutshill Tornadoes and Marcus Fenwick attended Hogwarts. There is also a boy named
            Robbie Fenwick who went to Hermione's parents for dental work, and bit her father. If all of these Fenwicks
            are related then they're probably Half-bloods: it isn't clear when Benjy attended Hogwarts, so he could be a
            Muggle-born, Mervin's father, and Marcus' grandfather. Robbie Fenwick would be related to them by the rest
            of the Muggle line.</p>

        <p>Curiously, the Harry Potter Wiki also refers to “Merwyn Finwick,” but as far as I can tell, this is an error.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Fig, Figg </b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English Fick, from the Middle English <em> fik, fig</em>, “to move quickly or restlessly, to
            shrink, flinch, retreat hurriedly,” or possibly from an unattested but plausible Middle English derivation
            of the Old English <em> gefic</em>, “deceit,” or from the Old French <em> fike</em>, “pointed implement for
            transfixing something or someone”; or a variant of Fidge, likewise derived from the Old French <em> fike
            </em> (or rather its own variant, <em> fiche</em>).</p>

        <p>Eleazar Fig was a professor at Hogwarts in the 19th century. Arabella Figg is a 20th century Squib, who is
            also called <em> Mrs. </em>Figg, implying that she married into the family. “Fig” might have become “Figg”
            (perhaps earlier than the 19th century, in a different branch of the family — I would suggest that there are
            also Figggs and Figgggs in Magical Britain, but we'd soon run out of room for other families), but Mrs. Figg
            might've married a Muggle for all we know.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Fudge</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Anglo-Norman personal name <em> Fulch </em> or <em> Fuche</em>, a diminutive of
            the Old French <em> Fulcher</em>, derived from <em> folk</em>, “people,” and <em> hari</em>, “army”; or an
            English name referring to the community of Fuge in Devonshire, derived from the Old English <em> feoh</em>,
            “cattle,” and <em> wic</em>, “farm, dairy farm, village.”</p>

        <p>Cornelius Fudge had a wizarding nephew, Rufus Fudge, which indicates that he had a magical sibling, and
            therefore at least one of his parents was magical (because it is extremely rare for two Muggle-borns to be
            born in the same family).</p>

        <p>
            <b>Green</b>
        </p>

        <p>English nickname for someone who was young, or favored this color, or played the part of the “Green Man” in
            festivals, or lived near the village green. Irish Anglicization of <em> Ó hUainín</em>, from <em>
                uaine</em>, “green,” and of <em> Ó Fathaidh </em> and <em> Ó Fathaigh</em>, from <em> faithche</em>,
            “lawn.” Also may be a German name referring to the areas of Green (in Rhineland-Palatinate) or Greene (Lower
            Saxony), or a Danish name referring to various communities such as Greene and Grenbole. May also be derived
            from the Ashkenazic Jewish <em> Grün </em> or <em> Grin</em>, meaning “green” in German and Yiddish.</p>

        <p>Beatrice Green owned a shop in Hogsmeade in the 19th century, Olivia Green was the DADA professor at Hogwarts
            during the 1990-91 school year, and Robert Green was a Chaser for the American National Quidditch Team in
            1994. The name is common and it may be that none of them are related.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Grimshaw</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to one of two Lancashire communities named Grimshaw, either from the Old Norse
            personal name <em> Grimr</em>, meaning “masked person” and referring to the shape-changing aspect of Odin,
            or the Old English <em> grima</em>, “specter, goblin” and <em> sceaga</em>, “corpse.” In the context of
            shapeshifting, it's worth noting the sense of “wolf” in the name <em> Shaw</em>.</p>

        <p>Who the fuck names their kid “Coeus”? That family is definitely magical.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Hedgeflower</b>
        </p>

        <p>Not attested in Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Gwendoline Hedgeflower attended Hogwarts in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Jones</b>
        </p>

        <p>English and Welsh patronym derived from <em> Jon </em> or <em> Jone</em>, a form of John, ultimately derived
            from the Hebrew <em> Yohanan</em>, “Jehovah has favored (me with a child)” or “may Jehovah favor (this
            child).” It may also refer to someone who lived or work at the house of someone named John.</p>

        <p>Gwenog Jones (b. 1968) has a Welsh given name and plays for the Holyhead Harpies, who are named after a town
            in Wales. Megan Jones (sorted 1991) is a Half-blood who is probably related, because her given name is Welsh
            as well. Gwenog is about twelve years older than her and might be a cousin or aunt. There's also a Hestia
            Jones, who fought Voldemort during the Second War and may be related.</p>

        <p>That said, “Jones” is the most common surname in Wales and the second most common surname in England, so if
            there's going to be two unrelated families with the same name running around Magical Britain, the Joneses
            are as likely as anybody.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Jorkins</b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglicization of the northern Irish name Ó Corcáin, “descendant of Corcán,” a diminutive of <em> corc</em>,
            “crimson.”</p>

        <p>We know of many people named “Jorkins,” if we go by the films: Albert and Primrose; their children Granville,
            Grimwold, and Griselda; a Ministry spokeswizard named Stamford; and of course Bertha.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Ketsueki</b>
        </p>

        <p>Japanese name meaning “blood.” It is not attested among Muggles.</p>

        <p>Victor Ketsueki attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Kettleburn</b>
        </p>

        <p>Possibly a variant of the English name <em> Kettleby</em>, referring to the community of Kettleby or Kettelby
            in Lincolnshire. May also refer to the community of Kettleburgh in Suffolk.</p>

        <p>Silvanus Kettleburn, who taught Care of Magic Creatures before Hagrid took the job, had magical parents, but
            their own parentage is unknown. There are precious few Kettleburns in British genealogical records, and on
            that basis I'll argue that it's a magical family name.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Lovegood</b>
        </p>

        <p>According to House of Names, there was a noble house by the name of Lovegood in Cornwall around the 10th
            century, but I'm never quite sure whether I can trust that website even as far as I can throw it. It's
            interesting to note, given Luna's first name, that <em> love </em> (or <em> louve</em>) means “wolf” or
            “she-wolf” in some dialects of French. It may also simply be a variant of “Lovegod.”</p>

        <p>Luna Lovegood attended Hogwarts from 1992 to 1998. Her father, Xenophilius Lovegood, was a wizard, and with a
            name like “Xenophilius,” he almost certainly had at least one magical parent.</p>

        <p>
            <b>MacGillony</b>
        </p>

        <p>Not attested in Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Elspeth MacGillony attended Hogwarts from 1988 to 1995.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Moonshine</b>
        </p>

        <p>Not really attested in Muggle records, though Geneanet says there were a handful of Moonshines in Manchester.
            The earliest sense of the word <em> moonshine </em> is “moonlight, the shining of the moon,” and then
            “appearance without substance, pretense, fiction,” perhaps in the sense of “moonshine in water.” Both are
            attested in the 15th century. The sense of “illegally produced or smuggled alcohol” dates no earlier than
            the late 18th century, when it appears in reference to smuggling on the coast of Kent and Sussex.</p>

        <p>Regulus Moonshine was brewing potions in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>
            <strong>Mulciber</strong>
        </p>

        <p>Not attested in Muggle records, so far as I can tell. “Mulciber” is another name for the Roman god Vulcan,
            from the Latin <em> mulceo</em>, “I soften,” as a blacksmith softens iron, and also the name of the
            architect of the Hellish city of Pandemonium in John Milton's poem <em> Paradise Lost</em>.</p>

        <p>There were at least two Mulcibers, both of whom were Death Eaters, and the first of which was a contemporary
            of Voldemort's.</p>

            <b>Oakham</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to communities of that name in Rutland, Surrey, and Sussex.</p>

        <p>Hecate Oakham, who attended Hogwarts in the 1990s, has an odd name for a Muggle-born, so it's probable that
            at least one of her parents is magical.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Pinkstone</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to the community of Pinxton in Derbyshire. Various sources refer to “an Old English
            personal name <em> Penec</em>,” but do not elaborate. The name may be derived from the name of Drogo fitz
            Pons, a Norman marcher lord who held the town for his lord William Peveril. He named the community
            Ponceston, and that name then changed to Penekeston and then to Pinxton.</p>

        <p>The connection between Pinkstone and “Peveril,” i.e. Peverell, feels suggestive enough to at least put this
            family on the “maybe” pile.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Patil</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of Patel, most common in the states of Karnataka and Maharashtra (in the latter of which it is the
            most common surname) in Western India, and meaning “village headman.”</p>

        <p>It is unlikely for two siblings to both be Muggle-borns, but Padma and Parvati are twins, and God alone knows
            whether that would affect anything. Their parents are keeping up with the news enough to consider
            withdrawing the twins from Hogwarts, but nothing says that Muggle parents can't read <em> The Daily
                Prophet</em>. However, the HP Wiki points out Pansy once spoke to Parvati as if they knew each other —
            ““Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.” — and if we accept this then they're at least
            Half-bloods. The Wiki further suggests that Pansy would only have been allowed to socialize with
            Pure-bloods, but that's less certain and the Patils might have some other reason to be acquainted with the
            Parkinsons, so I'm only placing them in the “Possible” category.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Prince</b>
        </p>

        <p>Generally a Middle English nickname derived from the Old French <em> prince</em>, which means how it sounds.
            May also be derived from the German and Ashkenazic Jewish name <em> Prinz</em>, likewise meaning “prince.”
        </p>

        <p>Eileen Prince was assumed (by Harry) to be a pure-blood, but this isn't specifically stated to be true. It
            probably is, though.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Quirrell</b>
        </p>

        <p>Nickname derived from the Middle English <em> squirel </em> (Old French <em> esquireul</em>), “squirrel,”
            perhaps due to a squirrel-like appearance or the agility or thrift thereof.</p>

        <p>The HP Wiki says that Quirrell is a Half-blood but doesn't properly cite this, and even if he is, we don't
            know which which side of his family the magic comes from. There are hardly any Muggle Quirrells, though, so
            the name is <em> probably </em> magical. Maybe his mum's a Muggle, or one of his maternal grandparents.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Rakepick</b>
        </p>

        <p>Not attested in Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Patricia Rakepick lived through the latter half of the 20th century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Sapworthy</b>
        </p>

        <p>Sap generally refers to the liquid bits of a plant: the sap of a tree, of course, or the juice of a fruit,
            occasionally even the latex of a leaf. The suffix -worthy is generally derived from <em>worthi</em>,
            “enclosure, enclosed homestead.” Not attested in Muggle records.</p>

        <p>It isn't clear when Selina Sapworthy lived.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Smith </b>
        </p>

        <p>Oldest fucking name in the book. It means “smith.” This might refer to a person's occupation as a blacksmith,
            to their habitation in or by a blacksmith's shop, or to some other place already named “smith.” Could also
            be an Anglicization of the Irish or Scottish <em> Mac Gobhann </em> or <em> Mac Gabhann</em>, meaning “son
            of the smith.”</p>

        <p>Hepzibah Smith owned Helga Hufflepuff's Cup. Zacharias Smith is not explicitly stated to be a relation of
            hers, but he's a Hufflepuff as well and we're probably meant to infer a connection between them. There may
            also be someone in Harry's year by the name of Sally Smith (or Georgina Smith), who may or may not be
            related: Zacharias Smith was escorted from Hogwarts by his father, with no mention of a sister, but you
            could argue, if you wanted, that the sister hadn't come to Harry's notice or had decided to not leave
            Hogwarts.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Swordbane</b>
        </p>

        <p>This is almost certainly the name of a magical family. There is no trace of it in Muggle genealogies.</p>

        <p>Bethany Swordbane attended Hogwarts in the 21st century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Tintwhistle</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably refers to the Derbyshire community of Tintwhistle, which may be derived from an extinct name for the
            River Etherow (the element <em>tin</em>, “river,” was common in Celtic river names) and the Old English
            <em>twisla</em>, “confluence,” also in reference to the River Etherow. As a surname, it is not attested in
            Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Isabella Tintwhistle was a student at Hogwarts during the 1996-97 school year.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Umbridge</b>
        </p>

        <p>Post-Medieval form of Ambrose, an English and Scottish name derived from the French given name <em>
                Ambroise</em>, ultimately derived from the Greek <em> ambrosios</em>, “immortal, divine.” May also be
            derived from the Irish <em> Mac Ambróis</em>, son of Ambrose, from West Munster.</p>

        <p>Dolores Umbridge is a Half-blood and we don't know her father's blood status, but that “my dad was on the
            Wizengamot” lie of hers would fall apart pretty easily if there hadn't been an Umbridge there.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Vane</b>
        </p>

        <p>In Kent, a variant of Vanes, a Norman name referring to the community of Vains in Normandy. It might also be
            a variant of the Middle English <em> Fayne</em>, “glad, friendly.”</p>

        <p>Emma Vane (sorted 1991) is only canonical to the films, where there is a permission slip with her name on it,
            signed by “Mrs. Vane.” Thomas Vane is canonical to the books in the sense that his name shows up on a
            representation of the Marauder's Map in the Illustrated Edition of POA. There's also a Muggle by the name of
            Emma Vane, mentioned in a poster in Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows film. If you are willing to say that there
            are any Vanes at all, then let's put all this together: Emma (the witch) and Thomas are siblings, Emma (the
            muggle) is their mother, their father is therefore a wizard, and maybe there are other magical Vanes. Also,
            let's say that Mrs. Vane signed the permission slip because Mr. Vane was killed in the First War, because
            why not. There's also, of course, <em> Romilda </em>Vane. If you take only the books as canon, then she
            might be anything. Otherwise, maybe Emma and Thomas are her siblings, or her cousins (we don't have enough
            cousins of the same name in the canon).</p>

        <p>
            <b>Vector</b>
        </p>

        <p>Derived from the given name Hector, “holding fast,” which was brought to Britain via the Normans. Present in
            both England and Scotland according to FamilySearch. Finding actual people who were actually named “Vector”
            has been a handful of heck, but I found them in Surrey and in (West Riding of) Yorkshire.</p>

        <p>There are supposedly no Muggle-borns in Slytherin, but even if we accept that, we don't know whether Septima
            Vector might have Muggles on her mother's side or her father's. Because there are nearly zero Muggles
            surnamed “Vector,” however, I think that it's probably a magical surname.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Vexmoor</b>
        </p>

        <p>Not attested in Muggle records, so far as I can tell. “Moor” may be derived from the Middle English <em>
                more</em>, “moor, marsh, fen,” but also from the Old French <em> more</em>, “Moor,” referring to someone
            of North African descent, generally via Spain, and “Vex” can refer to various Spanish communities by the
            name of Vea, so they may be, in other words, the Moors of Vea.</p>

        <p>Cordelia Vexmoor and her sister, Veronica, were both witches and probably lived during the 21st century.
            Cordelia inherited ownership of a magical ship.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Webb</b>
        </p>

        <p>English surname derived from the Middle English <em> webbe</em>, “weaver,” referring to someone of that
            occupation.</p>

        <p>Ida Webb worked for the Ministry (presumably) in 1932. In the 1990s, there was a shop called Cobb &amp; Webbs
            in Knockturn Alley.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Zabini</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of Zannini, which is an Italian diminutive of Zanni, which is a Venetian form of Gianni, which is a
            diminutive of Giovanni, which is an Italian form of John, which is ultimately derived from the Hebrew
            Yohanan, “Jehovah has favored (me with a child)” or “may Jehovah favor (this child).” The HP Wiki wants you
            to know that it also looks a little like <em> zabaione</em>, a kind of Italian custard.</p>

        <p>Considering how Blaise talked about “blood traitors,” it's plausible that the Zabinis are a Pure-blood
            family. If the films are canonical then another Zabini supported Grindelwald, so the family has been magical
            at least since the 1930s.</p>

        <summary>Names A-M</summary>

        <p>
            <b>Birch</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Old English <em> birce</em>, “birch,” probably referring to someone who lived
            among birch trees.</p>

        <p>Brevis Birch played for the Tutshill Tornadoes in 1999. Trevor Birch was a student at Hogwarts in 1996, and
            his mother was a witch.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Brocklehurst</b>
        </p>

        <p>Purportedly refers to “a place near Accrington named Brocklehurst,” but I've had trouble identifying further
            details. Derived from the Old English <em> brocc-hol</em>, “badger's sett,” and <em> hyrst</em>, “wooded
            hill.”</p>

        <p>Mandy Brocklehurst (sorted 1991) is a Half-blood. We don't know anything further.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Cattermole</b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglicization of a Flemish name that is unidentified but may be derived from the Old French <em> quatre
                moles</em>, “four mills,” perhaps referring to the community of Quatre-Moulins in Belgium.</p>

        <p>Reginald Cattermole was not a Muggle-born, but we know nothing else. His children were certainly Half-bloods,
            because their mother was a Muggle-born.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Corner</b>
        </p>

        <p>Possibly derived from the Anglo-Norman <em> cornier </em> (Old French <em> corneor</em>), “hornblower.” May
            be a variant of Crowner, referring to a person who lived on a corner.</p>

        <p>Michael Corner (sorted 1991) is a Half-blood. We don't know anything further.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Dawlish</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the Scottish name Dalgleish, a Midlothian and Selkirkshire name referring to the Selkirkshire
            community of Dalglas, from the Celtic <em> dol</em>, “field,” and <em> glas</em>, “green.” May also refer to
            the English community of Dawlish in Devon, named after a Welsh river whose name meant “black stream.”</p>

        <p>John Dawlish was an Auror in the 1990s. Helen Dawlish attended Hogwarts in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Davis</b>
        </p>

        <p>Various origins exist. Especially in Wales and regions with significant Welsh immigration, it is derived from
            the patronym <em> ap Dafydd</em>, “Dafydd's son.” In Ireland and Scotland, it is an adaptation of Mac
            Daibhéid, “David's son.” <em> Davy </em> and <em> Davies </em> are common variants.</p>

        <p>We don't know what's up with Tracey Davis. Is her last name actually Davies? Does she even exist in Rowling's
            personal canon? Who the fuck knows. Tracey was listed as a Half-blood on Rowling's classlist and that's been
            good enough for the fandom.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Dunn</b>
        </p>

        <p>Refer to this name's entry under Category 2C: Established (Other).</p>

        <p>
            <b>Farley</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to various communities by that name, from the Old English <em> fearn</em>, “fern,” and
            <em> leah</em>, “woodland clearing.” In Ireland, maybe be an anglicization of the Gaelic name O Fearghaile,
            from Fearghal, “man of valour.”</p>

        <p>Gemma Farley was a prefect at Hogwarts by 1991. Bella, Charlie, Jake, and Madge Farley were reported missing
            on Potterwatch in 1997.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Griffiths</b>
        </p>

        <p>Welsh patronym derived from Gruffud, of unclear meaning. Attested most often in Glamorgan and western
            England.</p>

        <p>Glynnis Griffiths played Quidditch in 1953. Wilda Griffiths played Quidditch in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Grimblehawk</b>
        </p>

        <p>The name Grimble is a Norfolk and Suffolk variant of Gribble, a Norman name derived from the Germanic name
            Grimbald, from <em> grim</em>, “mask, helmet,” and <em> bald</em>, “bold, brave.” The name Hawk may come
            from the Middle English <em> havoc, havek, hauk</em>(Old English <em> hafoc</em>), “hawk or falcon,”
            referring to a breeder or trainer of predatory birds, or someone with the behavior of such a bird; or from
            the Middle English <em> halke </em> (Old English <em> halh</em>), “dweller in the nook or corner”; or from
            the Old English personal name <em> Hafoc</em>, “hawk.”</p>

        <p>Mathilda Grimblehawk worked for the Ministry of Magic around the turn of the 21st century. Her uncle Abraham
            Grimblehawk also worked for the Ministry at some point, so at least one of Mathilda's paternal grandparents
            was magical.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Goshawk</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English <em> goshauk</em>, “goshawk.”</p>

        <p>At least some of Miranda Goshawk's sisters were magical, so she almost certainly had at least one magical
            parent.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Hayden</b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglicization of the Irish name O hÉideáin, “descendant of Éideáin,” a diminutive of <em> éideadh</em>,
            “clothes, armor.” English name referring to various locations by the name of Hayden or Haydon, derived from
            the Old English <em> heg</em>, “hay,” or <em> gehaeg</em>, “fence, enclosure,” and <em> dun</em>, “hill.” In
            the latter case, attested in Cambridgesire, Dorset, Gloucestershire, Norfolk, Oxfordshire, Someset, and
            Wiltshire.</p>

        <p>Corey Hayden attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991. Their parents ran a magical shop in Hogsmeade.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Hopkins</b>
        </p>

        <p>English and Welsh diminutive derived from <em> Hobb</em>, itself a diminutive of <em> Robert</em>. Most
            common in southern Wales and southern England.</p>

        <p>Wayne Hopkins (sorted 1991) is a Half-blood. In some of the video games there's also a Carl Hopkins (sorted
            1990), but this doesn't tell us anything about their parents.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Jordan</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Christian personal name Jordan, referring to the river Jordan (in Hebrew,
            Yarden), derived from the Hebrew <em> yarad</em>, “to go down,” i.e. to the Dead Sea, into which the river
            flowed. As a Christian name, referred to the river in which Jesus Christ was baptized.</p>

        <p>Lee Jordan attended Hogwarts from 1989 to 1996. His father was a wizard.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Karasu</b>
        </p>

        <p>In Japanese, <em> Karasu </em> means “crow, raven,” or “to drain; to exhaust; to wither, to kill; to let dry;
            to yell oneself hoarse.”</p>

        <p>Tulip Karasu attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991. Her parents worked for the DMLE Mary and Rosa Karasu are
            her (magical) grandparents, whether they're a couple, successive ex-wives, or something else.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Khanna</b>
        </p>

        <p>Despite the resemblance to “Khan,” the names are unrelated. Khanna is a Punjabi name derived from the
            Sanskrit <em> shankan</em>, referring to the sun.</p>

        <p>Rowan Khanna attended Hogwarts in the 1980s. Rowan's parents ran a tree farm that supplied wood for wands and
            broomsticks, so Rowan presumably had at least one magical parent. Rowan also had at least one uncle, named
            Ollie, and possibly another uncle, either of whom might have been maternal, paternal, or honorary. The
            latter uncle (if there are two) was a broom-maker by trade, meaning he was a wizard, but this doesn't tell
            us much about Rowan's parentage: he could easily be the magical brother of a Muggle who met Rowan's other
            parent through their broom-making sibling.</p>

        <p>Ashok Khanna was a student at Hogwarts during the 1993-94 school year. He may or may not be related, but
            Rowan mentioned having a brother (younger in the English translation of <em> Hogwarts Mystery</em>, and
            older in the Chinese translation).</p>

        <p>
            <b>Kim</b>
        </p>

        <p>Korean surname, meaning “gold.” About twenty-percent of Koreans bear this surname.</p>

        <p>Jae Kim attended Hogwarts in the 1980s. At least one of his parents was magical, because they took him to the
            Three Broomsticks for his birthday once. His mother was a fan of a wizarding opera singer named Zendra Xeep,
            but she could easily be a Muggle who learned of Xeep through her husband's connection to the magical world.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Lee</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to someone who lived near a meadow or patch of arable land, from the Middle English
            <em> lee </em> (Old English <em> lea</em>), “wood or glade,” or referring to many various communities by the
            name of Lee. Anglicization of the Irish name Ó Laoidhigh, “descendant of Laoidheach,” derived from <em>
                laoidh</em>, “poem, song,” originally referring to the occupation of a poet.</p>

        <p>Barnaby Lee attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991. His parents were Death Eaters in the First War, and
            presumably died in Azkaban because they weren't broken out in the 1990s. Barnaby Lee's paternal uncle,
            Cecil, worked in the Werewolf Capture Unit. His grandmother was a Dark witch and some nasty tendencies where
            Muggles were concerned.</p>

        <p>All this said, it isn't clear whether Barnaby is a Half-blood or a Pure-blood, or how long the “Lee” name has
            circulated in Magical Britain: Barnaby Lee's father and uncle probably had at least one magical parent, but
            that parent might have been their mother; and we can assume that his grandmother didn't marry a Muggle, but
            she might be his maternal grandmother.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Li</b>
        </p>

        <p>Depending on the character used, several meanings in Mandarin are possible,: “benefits,” “black,”
            “ceremonies, etiquette,” “chestnut,” “encourage,” “multitude,” “plum,” “rules,” “sharp, fortunate,” and
            “strict, rigorous.” <em> Li</em>, “plum” is also attested as a Vietnamese name. It's also a Norwegian
            surname, meaning “mountain slope, hillside” and referring to various farmsteads.</p>

        <p>Sue Li (sorted 1991) is a Half-blood. We don't know anything further.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Lobosca</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably a variant of the southern Italian name Lobosco, a variant of Bosco, from the Italian <em>
                bosco</em>, “wood,” referring to a forester or someone who lives near or in a forest.</p>

        <p>Chiara Lobosca attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991. Her father was an Arithmancer, and her mother was an
            Obliviator. We don't know anything about her grandparents.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Lupin</b>
        </p>

        <p>May refer to the community of Lippingcotts in Devon, though the exact meaning is unclear. May refer to the
            community of Campagna Lupia in Venice, or Lupia in Scigliano (both in Italy), or the Italian community of
            Lecce.</p>

        <p>Remus Lupin's mother is a Muggle. His father's blood status is unclear; he (initially) shared the common
            wixen prejudice against werewolves, but Muggle-borns can be bigots too.</p>

        <p>
            <b>McNully</b>
        </p>

        <p>Northern Irish variant of the name McNeilly, an anglicization of Mac an Fhilidh, “son of the poet,” most
            common in Antrim.</p>

        <p>Murphy McNully attended Hogwarts in the late 1980s and early 1990s. His mother taught him the Blackboard
            Writing Spell, so she was a witch.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Murk</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably an Anglicization of the Danish name Mørk, from the Old Norse <em> myrkr,</em>“dark,” or the Swedish
            name Mörk, from the Old Norse <em> myrkr</em>, “dark,” or…</p>

        <p>Ismelda Murk attended Hogwarts in the 1980s. Her older sister worked at the Ministry of Magic. Their parents
            aren't explicitly described as magical, but it's exceedingly rare for two siblings to both be Muggle-borns,
            so probably at least one is.</p>

            <b>Patel</b>
        </p>

        <p>Indian name meaning “village headman,” most common in Gujarat, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, derived from the
            Sanskrit <em> paṭṭakila</em>, “tenant of royal land.”</p>

        <p>Ashish Patel was a student at Hogwarts during the 1993-94 school year. Bhavana Patel was a student at
            Hogwarts during the 1996-97 school year. Riya Patel worked for the Ministry of Magic in the 2010s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Perks</b>
        </p>

        <p>West Midlands variant of Parks, an English or Scottish name often derived from the Middle English (Old French
            <em> parc</em>) <em> parc</em>, “park, enclosure,” referring to the grounds of a manor house or deer park;
            but it may also be derived from <em> Parkin</em>, a Medieval diminutive of Peter.</p>

        <p>Sally-Anne Perks (sorted 1991) is a Half-blood. We don't know anything further.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Pickering; Picquery</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to the North Yorkshire community of that name, derived from the Old English word
            Piceringas, from <em> pic</em>, “sharp point (of a hill)” and <em> ora</em>, “edge.”</p>

        <p>Constance Pickering was probably born in the late 1980s or during the 1990s. She had a sister and two
            brothers, at least one of whom was older and may be Adam Pickering, who attended Hogwarts in the 1990s. The
            other brother was a Squib. Their mother made and sold alcoholic pumpkin juice, and their (presumably
            paternal) grandfather, Matthias Pickering, was a wizard. They also had a witch for a grandmother, but it's
            unclear on which side, and a Muggle grandfather, who is presumably their maternal grandfather.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Reynolds</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English name Reynold, derived from the Norman personal name Reinald or Reynaud, from the
            ancient Germanic name Raginald, derived from <em> ragin</em>, “counsel, decision,” and <em> wald</em>,
            “rule, ruler.” In Ulster, an Anglicization of the Irish name Mac Raghnaill, from Raghnall, which is cognate
            with “Reynold.”</p>

        <p>Maisy Reynolds was a student at Hogwarts during the 1997-98 school year. Alecto Carrow “paid a visit” to her
            father, after which he was alive enough to be theoretically be paid a second visit, so he probably wasn't a
            Muggle, and plausibly wasn't a Muggle-born, either.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Sawley</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name probably referring to one of two communities of that name in West Riding of Yorkshire (where
            most instances of this surname are found), but possibly also to a community of that name in Derbyshire. May
            also be a Scottish name referring to the Gloucester community of Sudeley, or an Anglicization of the Irish
            name Mac Solly, or a French name derived from <em> Sol</em>, referring (according to the Internet Surname
            Database) to <em> solum</em>, “ground floor, threshing floor.”</p>

        <p>Lynette Sawley was a student at Hogwarts during the 1993-94 school year, the 1996-97 school year, and
            presumably others as well. Her mother cared about who Harry Potter was, so…witch, probably?</p>

        <p>
            <b>Scamander</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably refers to the Trojan (in Greek myth) river god Scamander or to the river Scamander, where that god
            dwelt. Possibly derived from <em> skazo</em>, “to limp, to stumble (over an obstacle)” or <em> skaios</em>,
            “left(i.e. left-handed), awkward,” and <em> andros</em>, “man,” ie. “limping man” or “awkward man,” possibly
            referring to a river that meanders, or has many bends, thereby “limping” across the land. Not attested in
            Muggle records.</p>

        <p>Newt Scamander lived through most or all of the 20th century. His brother, Theseus, worked for the British
            Ministry of Magic, and their mother bred Hippogriffs. Nothing has been said of their father. Newt's
            grandson, Rolf, was a wizard.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Sprout</b>
        </p>

        <p>Present in Lancashire, where it is probably derived from the Middle English <em> sprout</em>, “new shoot of a
            plant, bud,” but may be a variant of Sprott (from the Middle English <em> sprot</em>, “herring, sprat,” or
            <em> sprout</em>) or Sproat (the same as Sprott). May also be derived from the Middle Dutch <em>
                sprute</em>, “sprout, shoot.”</p>

        <p>Pomona Sprout remained at Hogwarts during Voldemort's occupation, so she isn't a Muggle-born.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Tande</b>
        </p>

        <p>Norwegian name referring to one of several farmsteads of that name, from the Old Norse name Tandar, possibly
            derived from the Old Norse <em> tonn</em>, “tooth.”</p>

        <p>Sujita Tande was a student at Hogwarts during the 1993-94 school year. Lina Tande was a student at Hogwarts
            during the 1996-97 school year. If they were siblings, then they probably weren't Muggle-borns, but we don't
            know enough to guess which of her parents were magical, if not both.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Thicknesse</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to a place called Thicknes in Staffordshire.</p>

        <p>Presumably not a Muggle-born, because he was put in charge of the Ministry while Voldemort ran it.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Tuttle</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name, most popular in Berkshire, Norfolk, and Suffolk, that is probably a variant of the name
            Thirkell, from the personal name Thortekill, from <em> Thorr</em>, “Thor,” and <em> ketill</em>, “kettle,
            cauldron.”</p>

        <p>Liz Tuttle attended Hogwarts in the 1980s. Her older sister was a witch, and their mother was a Seer, who was
            taught magic after the manner of Uagadou by her parents.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Warrington</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to the Lancashire community of Warrington, derived from the Old English <em>
                wering</em>, “dam,” and <em> tun</em>, “farmstead, estate.” FamilySearch reports the existence of
            another Warrington in Buckinghamshire but for whatever reason says that this is unlikely to be the source of
            the surname.</p>

        <p>Ivy and Winifred Warrington attended Hogwarts in the 21st century. Their maternal grandmother was a witch.
            Their father was a Muggle.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Winger</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name, most popular in Essex, derived from the Middle English personal name <em> Wingar</em>, from the
            Old English <em> wine</em>, “friend,” and <em> gar</em>, “spear.” Some historians report a village in East
            Anglia by the name of Winger, but the village no longer stands, if it ever existed.</p>

        <p>Someone by this name was a reporter for the <em> Daily Prophet</em>. He and his wife (who was also magical)
            were killed by Death Eaters sometime between 1978 and 1981. Their son attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Wynch</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English name Winch, from the Middle English <em> winche</em>, “winch, pulley,” as well as
            “well,” from which a winch could extract water, and probably referring to someone who lived beside a well or
            from a sharp bend in a river or valley, which might also be described as a “winch”; or referring to either
            of the communities of East Winch and West Winch in Norfolk, whose names are probably derived from the Old
            English <em> winn</em>, “pasture, meadow,” and <em> wic</em>, “dwelling, farmstead.”</p>

        <p>Mervyn Wynch was a Prefect by 1993. He may be related to one of the co-owners of Wynch &amp; Tugg Movers, a
            company in Diagon Alley.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Wolpert</b>
        </p>

        <p>German name referring to the personal name Waldobert, from <em> waltan</em>, “rule,” and <em> berht</em>,
            “bright, shining.” The Internet Surname Database suggests that it may also be derived from a name such as
            Wulfert, meaning “wolf-hard.”</p>

        <p>Nigel Wolpert was sorted into Gryffindor in 1994. Jamie Wolpert was a Muggle journalist who wrote for <em>The
                Guardian</em> in 1996. If Nigel is Jamie's kid, then Jamie's spouse must be magical, because Nigel
            attended Hogwarts during the 1997-98 school year, when only Half-bloods and Pure-bloods were permitted.</p>

            <b>Caplan</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English and French name Chaplin (by way of Caplin), derived from the Middle English <em>
                capelein </em> (Old French <em> chapelain</em>), “chantry priest.” Anglicization of the Ashkenazic
            Jewish name Kaplan, a variant of Cohen derived from the German <em> Kaplan</em>, “chaplain, curate.”</p>

        <p>Diego Caplan attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991. His grandfather was a proficient duelist, but we don't know
            which side of the family he was on.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Cole</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English and Old French personal name <em> Col </em> and others, all
            diminutives of Nicol, a common name from the middle of the 13th century onward, and attested in Scotland and
            in Fermanagh in Northern Ireland. In other cases may be derived from the Middle English personal name Col,
            derived from the Old English <em> col </em> or <em> cola</em>, “coal; coal-black hair; swarthy,” and in this
            sense is most common in northern and eastern England. In Ireland and Scotland, may also be derived from the
            name McCool, derived from Mac Giolla Comhghaill, “son of the servant (or devotee) of St. Comhgall.”</p>

        <p>Mrs. Cole was a Muggle in the 1930s. Angelica Cole attended Hogwarts from 1980 to 1987. The HP Wiki thinks
            that they belong to the same family, but there's nothing to indicate this. Mrs. Cole was a Mrs., though, so
            she might've had children (or niblings for that matter).</p>

        <p>
            <b>Copper</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name in Kent and Surrey derived from the Middle English <em> copere</em>, “cooper,” referring to a
            maker or seller of buckets, casks, and tubs, or from the Middle English <em> copper </em> or <em>
                cupper</em>, referring to a maker of cups and small vessels. Also attested in Sussex and adjacent
            countries, probably as a variant of Coppard, from the Middle English <em> coppard</em>, derived from a
            diminutive of Jacob; or derived from the Middle English <em> coppe</em>, “top, head,” with a pejorative
            suffix. If Fred and George spoke Middle English, they might describe Percy as a coppard.</p>

        <p>Ben Copper was a Muggle-born who attended Hogwarts from 1984 to 1991.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Crane</b>

        <p>
            <b>Creevey</b>
        </p>

        <p>Irish and Scottish variant of Creevy, an anglicization of Mac Riabhaigh, from <em> riabhach</em>, “brindled,
            grizzled.”</p>

        <p>Colin and Dennis Creevey were Muggle-borns.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Cresswell</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English name Creswell, referring to various communities of that name in Derbyshire,
            Northumberland, and Staffordshire, derived from the Old English <em> caerse</em>, “cress,” and <em>
                wiella</em>, “stream.”</p>

        <p>Dirk Cresswell was a Muggle-born.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Entwhistle</b>
        </p>

        <p>Refers to the community of Entwistle in Lancashire, never mind the difference between “whistle” and “wistle.”
            Derived from the Old English <em> henna</em>, “water hen,” or <em> ened, </em> “duck,” and <em>
                twistla</em>, “tongue of land in a river fork.”</p>

        <p>Kevin Entwhistle was a Muggle-born. In the POA video game there's also someone by the name of Annabel
            Entwhistle, so she's non-canonical, she and Kevin are a rare case of Muggle-born siblings, or they just
            happen to share the same name.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Finch-Fletchley</b>
        </p>

        <p>Finch is derived from the Middle English <em> finch </em> (Old English <em> finc</em>), “finch,” to refer to
            a small, lively, and cheerful person. Fletchley may be derived from the Middle English <em> fleccher </em>
            (Old French <em> flechier</em>), “fletcher,” referring to a person who makes and sells arrows, and in
            connection with this it is worth noting that a finch is a bird and that arrows use feathers. Probably,
            however, it refers to the communities of Bletchley (in Buckinghamshire) or Bletchingley (Surrey). Yes, those
            start with a “B” and Fletchley starts with an “F,” but names sometimes do that.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Finnigan</b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglicization of <em> Ó Fionnagáin</em>, descendant of Fionnagán, meaning “white-haired; fair-haired.”</p>

        <p>Mirabel Garlick was a Muggle-born.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Granger</b>
        </p>

        <p>Derived from the Anglo-Norman <em> grainger </em> (Old French <em> grangier</em>), related to “granary” and
            referring to the occupation of farm bailiff, responsible for overseeing the collection of rent into the

        <p>
            <b>Haywood</b>
        </p>

        <p>English name referring to various communities named Haywood or Heywood, derived from the Old English <em>
                haeg</em>, “fence, enclosure,” and <em> wudu</em>, “wood.”</p>

        <p>Beatrice and Penny Haywood are witches, but their father is a Muggle.</p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>English name derived from the Middle English <em> leche</em>, “physician,” referring to medical practice,
            from practiced surgeons to providers of folk remedies.</p>

        <p>Nobby Leach was the first Muggle-born Minister for Magic.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Lockhart</b>
        </p>

        <p>English and Scottish name derived from the Old French <em> locart</em>, “one who squints, who is
            cross-eyed.”</p>

        <p>Gilderoy Lockhart's father is a Muggle, and his mother is a witch.</p>

        <p>
            <b>McGonagall</b>
        </p>

        <p>Irish and Scottish variant of McGonigle, an Anglicization of <em> Mac Conghail</em>, from <em> Conghal</em>,
            “valor hound.”</p>

        <p>The McGonagalls became a magical family when Robert McGonagall, a Muggle, married a witch.</p>

            <b>Riddle</b>
        </p>

        <p>Most often refers to the area of Ryedale in North Yorkshire, derived from the river Rye and the Old Norse
            <em> dalr</em>, “valley.” Has also been introduced by the Normans from the Old French personal name <em>
                Ridel</em>, possibly a diminutive of names such as Ridbald.</p>

        <p>Tom Riddle Senior was a Muggle.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Snape</b>
        </p>

        <p>Refers to various communities in northern England by the name of Snape, derived from the Middle English <em>
                snap</em>, “poor pasture, winter pasture.” It may also be derived Middle English <em> snap </em> (Old
            English snæp), “boggy piece of land.” The latter is slightly more likely, because it's the more common
            derivation in the Midlands, but both are plausible.</p>

        <p>Severus Snape is a wizard but his father, Tobias Snape, was a Muggle.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Thomas</b>
        </p>

        <p>Derived from the name <em> Thomas</em>, meaning “twin.” In Britain, most common in Wales and Cornwall, and is
            also associated with the Huguenots of France. In France, most common in the Vosges and Brittany.</p>

        <p>Dean Thomas is a Half-blood, but if “Thomas” were his father's name and also the name of a Pure-blood family,
            then this probably would have come up at some point and Dean wouldn't've spent seven years thinking he was a
            Muggle-born.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Tremlett</b>
        </p>

        <p>Norman English name referring to the French community of Les Trois Minettes. The family has been established
            in Devon since at least the 12th century.</p>

            <b>Tonks</b>
        </p>

        <p>In Staffordshire and Warwickshire, a shortened form of Tonkins, itself a variant of Tomkins, from the Middle

            but we don't know whether he was magical. She might have been a Muggle-born, they might have both been
            magical, or he might have been a Squib.</p>

        <p>Scottish and English name derived from the French <em> petit</em>, “little, small,” and <em> creu</em>,
            “growth.” Also attested in County Tyrone in Ireland since the 17th century, through Scottish and Huguenot
            settlers.</p>

        <p>Rowling considered “Enid Pettigrew” as a name for a Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, but this is a
            wisp of a might-have-been of a character. We might assume that Peter Pettigrew was at least a Half-blood on
            the basis that he joined Voldemort, but I've seen arguments that he's a Muggle-born.</p>

        <p>

        <p>Italian — primarily Campania — variant of the patronym Picardo, referring to the region of Picardy in

        </p>

        <p>Not really attested in Muggle records, though Geneanet says there were a few people by that name around
            Montpelier, France. The English <em> pyrite </em> refers to iron disulfide and similar sulfides, from the
            French <em> pyrite</em>, from the Latin <em> pyrites</em>, from the Greek <em> purites lithos</em>, “stone
            of fire; flint.” Perhaps better known as fool's gold.</p>

        <p>Argo Pyrites was an alchemist and the author of <em> Alchemy, Ancient Art and Science</em>. It's unclear when
            he lived, if he ever did (he only exists in draft versions of POS).</p>

        <p>
            <b>Quince; Quincey</b>
        </p>

            branch.”</p>

            <em> wulf</em>, “wolf.” Or, an Anglicization of the Irish name <em> O Raghaill</em>, “courageous.”</p>

        <p>
            <b>Rivers</b>
        </p>

        <p>Variant of the English River, which may be derived from the Middle English <em> atter evere </em> (Old
            English <em> yfer</em>), “at the brow or red,” referring to someone who lives at the slope or brow of a
            hill; or from the Middle English <em> revere</em>, “reiver, robber.”</p>

        <p>We know nothing about Oliver Rivers, except that he once existed in Rowling's classlist and was once named
            Oliver Quirrell. I like to think that Quirinus is his maternal uncle, but that's a headcanon, not an
            argument, so I have No Fucking Idea.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Roper</b>
        </p>

        <p>In Sussex, a variant of the English name Savage, from the Middle English <em> sauvage</em>, “wild, untamed.”
            May also be a French name referring to various communities by the name of Salvage or Le Salvage, in southern
            France.</p>

            <b>Shunpike</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably derived from the term <em> shunpike</em>, “side road or route; to avoid a turnpike by means of
            taking a side road.” As a word, attested by in the United States by 1800, but turnpikes have existed by that

        <p>Stan Shunpike was the conductor of the Knight Bus in the 1990s.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Sinistra</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably refers to a star Nu Ophiuchi (in the constellation of Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer), which is also
            called Sinistra, “left side.” May also be a variant of Sinistri, which is much better-attested (mostly in
            Italy) and is probably derived from either <em> sinistro</em>, “left, left-hand; grim, ominous,” or <em>
                sinistrare</em>, “to damage; to go badly.”</p>

        <p>Aurora Sinistra taught Astronomy at Hogwarts in the 1980s and 1990s (and possibly elsewhen).</p>

        <p>Probably refers to Sparrovale Farm, which is often erroneously spelled as “Sparrowvale,” founded in 1095 and
            named after Edward Rogers Sparrow. This is rather recent, though, so perhaps it actually refers to some
            other Sparrow's vale, now forgotten by Muggle history.</p>

        <p>Lucas Sparrowvale worked for the Ministry of Magic in the 21st century.</p>

        <p>
            <b>Spellman, Spielman</b>

            German name <em> Spielmann</em>, referring to a jester or tumbler, and derived from the German <em>
                spieler</em>, “player.” Spellman may also be an Anglicization of the Irish Mac Spealáin or Ó Spealáin,
            derived from <em> spealáin</em>, “scythe,” and more often Anglicized as Spillane; or an Anglicization of the
            German <em> Spellmann</em>, equivalent to Spielmann.</p>

        <p>We know nothing about either Spellman (of <em> Spellman's Syllabary</em>) or Rudolph Spielman (except that he

        <p>Anglicization of the Polish name Święch, a diminutive of the personal name Świętosław, Swiętobor, or

        <p>Siobhan Templeton was a student at Hogwarts during the 1993-94 school year.</p>

            <b>Thruston</b>

        <p>English variant of the name Thurston, referring to the Suffolk community of Thurston, derived from the Old

        <p>It's hard to find much on this name, or even its likely (Danish, German, Norwegian, Occitanian) variant, <em>

        <p>Derived from the Old French and Middle English given name <em> Turpin</em>, further derived from the Old

        <p>
            <b>Wagtail</b>
        </p>

        <p>Probably an English nickname referring to the small, ground-nesting bird of this name, named for their “near
            constant tail wagging.” May be a variant of Wagetail, for which no better etymology is known. Rare but not

        <p>English nickname derived from the Middle English <em> whit</em>, “white,” and <em> hed</em>, “head,” probably

        <p>
            <b>Whitehorn</b>
        </p>

        <p>English nickname possibly referring to a fair-colored or splendid trumpet or drinking horn. There is
            apparently some overlap in 14th century census records between “whitehorn” and “whitepintell” or
            “whitepincell,” <em> pintel </em> and <em> pincel </em> meaning “penis,” and therefore the full name meaning
            something along the lines of “fair-colored or splendid penis.”</p>

        <p>
            <b>Williams, Williamson, Williamsum</b>
        </p>

        <p>Anglo-Norman name derived from the Middle English William, from the Germanic Willihelm, <em> wil</em>, “will,
            desire,” and <em> helm</em>, “helmet, protection.” The variant <em> Williams </em> is common in Wales, and
            <em> Williamson </em> is a patronym common in Northern England, Northern Ireland, and Scotland. <em>
                Williamsum </em> appears to be a rare Scottish variant of Williamson.</p>

        <p>Williamson is an Auror, about whom we know nothing else. Dora Williams is a Hogwarts student in a couple of
            the video games, there is a Benjy Williams who plays Quidditch for Puddlemere United in other extrabiblical
            canons, and finally a D. Williams whose tombstone can be found in Godric's Hollow in a Deathly Hallows video
            game. In the <em> Fantastic Beasts </em> series there is also a C. Williamsum living in New York and working
            as a magical reporter. Even the three Williamses may not be related to each other, so these five might cover
            the whole spectrum by themselves.</p>

            <b>Yarrow</b>
        </p>

                cella</em>, “cell, small room,” referring to someone who lived near a hermit's cell. German and Jewish
            Ashkenazic name derived from the German <em> zelle</em>, “small workshop,” referring to someone who owned or
            was employed at such a place. Outside the Continent, best associated with the Huguenots.</p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>Derived from the diminutive of <em> Yona</em>, a Ukrainian variant of Jonas, a variant of John, ultimately
