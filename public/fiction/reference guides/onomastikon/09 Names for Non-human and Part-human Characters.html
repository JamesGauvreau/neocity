    <p>From Flitwick, Gringott, and Griphook, Cauchy (writer of "<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820" rel="nofollow">Blood Crest</a>")
        theorizes that goblin surnames are composed of of a four-letter verb followed by a four-letter noun, like
        “Nalrod Snipseed” and “Gornuk Turnlink.” To these, I've added Clipfume, Goadflux, Goadslab, Flitfume, and
        Rootcord (my goblins inherit the verb component from their teachers). For quick and simple names built along
        these lines, you can use the table below. Roll a couple of twenty-sided dice, or use <a

    <p>At the risk of mistaking noise for a signal, the elements <em>-bert</em>, <em>-agnok </em>(or <em>-nok</em>),
        <em>-uff</em>, and <em>ur-</em> (or <em>urg-</em>) all appear multiple times, and all canonical goblin names end
        in a consonant.

        <summary>A quick and dirty system for converting Norse names into goblin names:</summary>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove all syllables after the second.</li>
            <li>Remove diacritics.</li>
            <li>Replace repeated consonants (e.g. dd, kk) with single consonants (e.g. d, k).</li>
            <li>At the end of the name, remove any vowels.</li>
            <li>At the end of the name, replace -dr, -gr, -kr, etc. with -d, -g, -k, etc.</li>
            <li>Replace letters on the left side of each arrow with the letters on the right side: au → o, ð → t; f → v;
                ja → e; jo → i; oi → oe; s → z; y → i</li>
        </ol>

    <p><b>Names of Norse dwarves</b>, modified by the above system.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>An, meaning “friend.”</li>
        <li>Brak, meaning “blacksmith.”</li>
        <li>Dagvin, meaning “day-finder; magic-worker.”</li>
        <li>Dolg, meaning “warrior; enemy.”</li>
        <li>Eit, meaning “very old.”</li>
        <li>Felar, meaning “hidden.”</li>
        <li>Ginar, meaning “deceiver.”</li>
        <li>Hanar, meaning “skilled.”</li>
        <li>Lim, meaning “glow, gleam, shine.”</li>
        <li>Lit, meaning “red.”</li>

        <li>Thek, meaning “beloved.”</li>
        <li>Ur, meaning “smith.” It's a common component of goblin names and can easily be added as a prefix to other
            names, e.g. Uran, “smith of friends, one who makes friends easily”; Urnar, “smith of corpses, skilled
            killer”; Urvit, “smith of wisdom, scholar.”</li>

    <h1><a name="vampireCat" rel="nofollow" id="vampireCat"></a>Vampires<a href="#BackCat1" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>

    <p><b>Canonical vampires: </b> Amarillo Lestoat,<sup>G</sup> Blodwyn Bludd,<sup>G</sup> Carmilla
        Sanguina,<sup>G</sup> Gerard Le Croc,<sup>G</sup> Herbert Varney,<sup>G</sup> Lorcan d'Eath,<sup>P</sup> Qui
        LeBlanc,<sup>G</sup> Sanguini,<sup>B</sup> Victor Ketsueki,<sup>G</sup> and Vlad Drakul.<sup>G</sup></p>

    <p>Lorcan and Qui are part-vampires, so their names may not be examples of a traditional vampire name (if such a
        thing exists). “Sanguini” is obviously a blood pun, but it's an actual surname in Italy and Spain. Sanguini and
        Carmilla Sanguina may be related. Victor Ketsuekki was turned into a vampire (this may be what “part-vampire”
        refers to, but Qui LeBlanc's father is described as a vampire).</p>

    <p><b>Literary vampires: </b>Antonia (f) or Anthony (m), Augusta (f) or Augustus (m), Carmilla (f) or Carmillo (m),
        Clarimonde (f) or Claremont (m), Frances (f) or Francis (m), Gerald (m) or Geraldine (f), Lenore (f) or Leonard
        (m).</p>

    <p>Carmilla was probably derived from Carmella, referring to the Virgin Mary as <em> Our Lady of Mount Carmel </em>
        . Leonard isn't <em> really </em> a masculine form of Lenore, but there is none and that's close enough.</p>

    <p><b>People historically regarded as vampires: </b>Arnold Paul, George Grand, Elizabeth, Henry, Jack, James, Mercy,
        Peter, Wilfrid, and William Pool. “Brown” has shown up as a surname for purported vampires a couple times.
        William of Newburgh wasn't considered to be a vampire, but he wrote about them, and “William Newburgh” has a
        nice ring to it.</p>

    <p>If vampires are rare enough, perhaps they take names according to their hunting grounds or the place where they
        turned into vampires: Berwick, Breslau, Carfax, Corinth, Croglinhall, Ennerdale, Highgate, Pentsch, Styria,
        Marsden, Haidam, Melrose, Selene, and Visegrad all refer to historical or literary vampires. Some of these are
        provinces, others are cities, and a few are districts of cities. Names which refer to larger areas may be more
        prestigious if they imply that the vampire has forced out all the competition, but of course a small slice of
        prime hunting ground might be better-prized than a vast tract of wasteland.</p>

    <p><b>English names </b> include Adam (m) and Adamina (f), from the Hebrew <em> ‘adam</em>, “to be red,” and the
        diminutive Addy (m); Aldous (m), meaning “old”; Ambrose (m) or Ambrosia (f), from <em> ambrosios</em>,
        “immortal”; Blessing (m, f), derived from <em> blēdsian</em>, “to consecrate (with blood); Garnet (f), from the
        Middle English <em> gernet</em>, “dark red”; Radcliff (m) or Radclyffe (m), meaning “red cliff” in Old English;
        Read (m) or Reed (m), from the Old English <em> read</em>, “red”; Rowan (m), Rowen (m), or Rowanne (f),
        ultimately derived from the PIE <em> *reudh-</em>, “red, ruddy”; and Russell, a diminutive derived from the Old
        French <em> rous</em>, “red.”</p>

    <p><b>Irish names </b> include Ádhamh (m), an Irish variant of Adam (see above); Ciar (m), meaning “black,” or the
        diminutive Ciarán (m); Clancy (m, f), from <em> Flannchadh</em>, “red warrior”; Flann (m) and Flynn (m),
        originally a surname derived from <em> flann</em>, “blood red,” and the diminutives Flanagan (m) and Flannan
        (m); Flannery (f), from <em> Flannghal</em>, “red valour”; Harkin, a diminutive of <em> earc</em>, meaning “red,
        bloody,” or “piglet”; Ide, possibly meaning “thirst”; Rory (m, f) or Ruaidhrí (m), meaning “red king”; and
        Ruadhán, a diminutive derived from <em> rúad</em>, “red.”</p>

    <p><b>Scottish names </b>include Aodhagan (m) and Adhan (m), Scottish variants of Adam (see above), Rory (m, f) or
        Ruaridh (m), meaning “red king,” and the diminutive Roddy (m); and Ruadh (m), meaning “red,” as well as the
        anglicization Roy (m).</p>

    <p><b>Welsh names </b> include Blodeuwedd (f), who was transformed into an owl; Creiddylad or Creidylat (f), from
        <em> craidd</em>, “heart, center,” or <em> crau</em>, “blood,” and <em> dylad</em>, “flood”; Deryn (f, m),
        possibly meaning “bird”; Emryn (f) and Emrys (m), the given name of Merlin and derived from <em> ambrosios</em>,
        “immortal”; and Gwyar (m, f), meaning “blood, gore.”
    </p>

    <p><b>Other bat names </b>include Barbastel or Barbastelle, Flitter, Flindermouse or Flittermouse, Molossine or
        Molossus, Myote, Noctule, Pipistrelle, Reremouse, and Wallroost. Natalie, in reference to natalid bats, may be a
        bit of a stretch but I still like it.</p>

    <p>If you're willing to look at species of bats, there are several good nose-related names, including Broadnose,
        Heartnose, Hognose, Noseleaf, Shortnose, Spearnose, Swordnose, and Tubenose. You could also refer to faces
        (Dogface, Slitface, Stripeface), throats (Whitethroat, Yellowthroat), or wings (Bentwing, Whitewings). Other
        viable names referring to physical attributes include Blackear, Freetail, Hoarywattle, Hornskin, Longfingers,
        Longtongue, Thumbless, and Whitebelly.</p>

    <p>Other names based on species include Blackgild, Bronzesprite, Chocolate, Harlequin, Mimic, Rousette, Silvertip,
        Sombre, and Vespera or Vespers.</p>

    <p><b>Other names related to blood </b> include Euaimon, from <em> eu</em>, “good, well,” and <em> haima</em>,
        “blood”; Hyacinth, from whose blood the flower arose; Fjalarr and Galarr, who murdered the poet Kvasir and mixed
        his blood with mead; Pegasus, which sprang from the blood of Medusa (as a constellation, this would be
        especially apt for a vampire Black); Peony (said to have grown from the blood of Serbians killed during the
        Battle of Kosovo in 1389); Sangster, an English and Scottish name that actually means “singer,” but sure sounds
        like it's related to blood; and Sigurd, who bathed in the blood of a dragon.</p>

    <p><b>Other names related to darkness and night </b> include Ketil, meaning “kettle, cauldron,” and in which was
        caught the blood of sacrificed animals; Náttfari, “night-farer” or “night-traveler,” from <em> nátt</em>,
        “night,” and <em> fara</em>, “to go, to travel”; Náttolfr, from <em> nátt</em>, “night,” and <em> ulfr</em>,
        “wolf”; Náttsol, from <em> nátt</em>, “night,” and <em> sol</em>, “sun”; Noctiluna, meaning “night-shiner” or
        “moon”; Nox and Nyx, meaning “night” in Latin and Greek; Nyctimene, meaning “she who stays up at night”;
        Orpheus, which may be derived from <em> orphne</em>, “darkness of night.”</p>

    <p><b>Other owl names </b> include Axio, meaning “long-eared owl”; Billy Wix; Boobook; Hobhouchin; Houlet or Howlet;
        Madge; Mopork or Morepork; Oule; Padge; Parliament; Sawwhet or Saw-whet; Strich or Strick; Tyto; Ugla;
        Ugluspegill, meaning “owl mirror”; and Ullet. Stolas is the name of a demon in the <em> Ars Goetia</em>, and is
        often portrayed as an owl.</p>

    <p>Like bats, you can also find some good material (though not as much) by looking at species names, including
        Ashface, Bandbelly, Bareshank, Blackcap, Blackwhite, Burrower, Ochrebelly, Rustbar, and Whiteface.</p>

    <p><b>Other plant names </b>include Hawthorn, Millet, Nightshade, Oak, and Poppyseed.</p>

    <p>We don't have enough to go on. Fleur Delacour has a normal name, but she's only one-quarter veela, so that may
        not reflect veela naming practices. Delila has a normal name, too, but she only exists in one of the mobile
        games.</p>
    <h1><a name="werewolfCat" id="werewolfCat"></a>Werewolves<a href="#BackCat1" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <p><b>A wolf by any other name is still a wolf:</b> Lobo (m, Spanish), Lope (m, Spanish), Lopo (m, Portuguese), Loup
        (m, French), Lowell (m, French), Lupo (m, Italy), Lyall (m, Scottish), Shaw (m, Scottish), and Wilk (m, Polish)
        all mean “wolf.”</p>
    <h2>Wolves and werewolves in folklore and history</h2>
    <p>Benjamin is <a href="https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/367788?lang=bi">regarded as a werewolf</a> in some Jewish
        traditions (see also <a href="https://jewishmonsterhunting.com/2019/11/17/benjamin-is-a-predatory-wolf">this
            article</a>, which may be more approachable for the lay reader). </p>
    <p>Gwrgi Garwlwyd was the leader of a tribe of cinbin or “dogheads” fought by King Arthur. A werewolf who wanted to
        associate himself with Gwrgi might name himself Gwrgenau or Gorgenau, cenau meaning “cub, whelp.” </p>
    <p>Isengrim (from îsarn, “iron,” and grim, “grim, fierce, bold,” or grîma, “mask”) is a wolf from western European
        fables. Variations of the name include Isangrim, Isingrim, Isengrimus, and possibly Isegrimm.
    <h2>Other names</h2>
    <p>If your werewolves have recently organized into some sort of government and would like to give quasi-patriotic
        names to reflect their new reality, consider names like Electulf (elected- or chosen-wolf), Gardulf
        (garden-wolf), Liutulf (people-wolf), Maladulf (council- or meeting-wolf), Pandolf (band- or bond-wolf), and
        Reinulf (counsel-wolf). Other suitable names might be Maiulf (parent-wolf), reflecting the hope for stable
        descent; Winulf (friend-wolf); Wolfgang (wolf-journey) or Gangwolf, if they are immigrants; and Wulfsy
        (wolf-victory).</p>
    <p>Radulf, Ulfred, and Wulfred can be interpreted as meaning “wolf of counsel.” By contracting the first name, we
        get Ralf or Ralph. The feminine form is Ralphe, and other variants include Rafe and Rawe. In French, it becomes
        Raoul or (less commonly) Raul (m) or Rauline (f).</p>
        <p>Wolfenden means "the valley of Wulfhelm," referring to the township of Wolfenden in Lancashire.</p>
