    <h1><a name="house" rel="nofollow" id="house"></a>Names for Houses <a href="#BackCat1" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <p>It is plausible that the majority of wixes live in named houses (e.g. The Burrow). The practice of numbering
        houses by their street (e.g. 12 Grimmauld Place) was not universalized until 1765, and the regular use of
        house-names continued well into the 19th century.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The earliest house-names predate the Norman Conquest, and typically say something about the inhabitants (e.g.
        Sabelinesbury, or &ldquo;Sabeline&rsquo;s place&rdquo;), their activities (e.g. Tanninghouse, Webbeloft), or
        some obvious physical quality of the site (e.g. Red Gables, Two Chimneys). In the 14th century, we begin to see
        more houses that use heraldic emblems (e.g. The Crow), following the example of merchants and professionals who
        advertised their trade by symbols.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In <em>Sunnyside: A Sociolinguistic History of British House Names</em>, Laure Wright writes, &ldquo;This book
        contains many biographies, because house names result from the experiences of the people who live in
        them.&rdquo; Most house-names will fall into at least one of the following categories:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>References to another place that the owner appreciated, e.g. Ambleside, Broadstairs, Indiana. These names
            often (but not always) refer to a place that the owner personally visited. Consider locations that the
            denominator might have visited on their Grand Tour.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>References referring to physical qualities of the building, e.g. Crookedhouse, Greengate.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>References to natural qualities of the site, e.g. Hillcrest, River View.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>References to the building&rsquo;s original use, e.g. Forge Cottage, The Gatehouse, the Vicarage, Wool Hall.
        </li>
        <li>References to animals or plants frequently seen around the site, e.g. Fox Hollow, The Pines, Two
            Hoots.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>References to popular culture (generally in literature or theater), e.g. Elsinore, Toad Hall.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>References that just sound fancy, e.g. Gothic Villa, Islesworth. These are usually adopted by the
            upwardly-mobile, typically in pursuit of a contemporary fad. &ldquo;Malfoy Manor&rdquo; itself <a
                href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1c5pekd/britpick_manor_house_naming_potter_manor_and_so_on/">has
                struck some British readers</a> as a pretentious, nouveau riche sort of house-name. If you don&rsquo;t
            want that connotation, then it&rsquo;s worth noting that the term &ldquo;Malfoy Manor&rdquo; is only used a
            few times in text, and never by the Malfoys themselves. Maybe there&rsquo;s a more respectable name for
            their home, but after Lucius Malfoy&rsquo;s fuckup in the Department of Mysteries, his fellow Death Eaters
            purposefully call it something dumber (and Harry just calls it &ldquo;Malfoy Manor&rdquo; because he neither
            knows nor cares that it&rsquo;s got a different name).&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Abbey, Bury (a corruption of <em>burh</em>, &ldquo;fortified place&rdquo;), Castle, Court, Garden, Hall, House,
        Lodge, Park, Place, and Priory often show up in house-names, though they aren&rsquo;t required (such exclusions
        include Blackwell, The Cedars, and Townend). The term &ldquo;manor&rdquo; is used only rarely, because this term
        more properly refers to the whole estate, while the residence is a manor <em>house</em>. According to the Royal
        Mail, some of the most common house names in the U.K. include Highfield, Laurels, Mill House, Lakeside, Oak, the
        Old Rectory, Red House, Thornfield, Treetops, Wayside, and Yew Tree Cottage.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many place-names leave out apostrophes (e.g. Robins Nest) but this is not a strict rule. For a long time, the
        houses of nobility were typically named after the nearest village (e.g. if the Malfoys lived nearby the village
        of &ldquo;Pendle,&rdquo; then their manor house might once have been called &ldquo;Pendle Hall&rdquo;).
        &ldquo;Hall&rdquo; and &ldquo;house&rdquo; are frequent components of these names.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On Reddit, <a

            suggests</a> using Google Maps to find a village or natural feature nearby where you imagine the house to
        be. You can also check this <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_country_houses_in_the_United_Kingdom">list of country houses in
            the United Kingdom</a> to get a sense for the names that are used in this or that place (for example, if you
        want a different name for &ldquo;Malfoy Manor&rdquo; then you might want to check out the country houses in
        Wiltshire). <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1au2j5f/naming_places_and_ancestral_homes/kr1d1qn/">SleepyBeeper
            suggests</a> using Home, Cottage, or Place for primary homes, and Ch&acirc;teau or Mansion for the nouveau
        riche.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One final note: the well-to-do typically had both a country house (located on their estate) and a town house
        (located in the nearest major town). Grimmauld Place, for example, is probably &ldquo;just&rdquo; the Black
        family&rsquo;s town house (or one of them, since it wasn&rsquo;t out of the question for a well-off family to
        have multiple country or town houses).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For the Potter family&rsquo;s residence, I like &ldquo;Pottermoor&rdquo; (<a

    <h1><a name="war" rel="nofollow" id="war"></a>Names for the Wizarding Wars <a href="#BackCat1" rel="nofollow">▲</a>
    </h1>
    <p>First off, I don&rsquo;t like the terms &ldquo;First (and Second) Wizarding War&rdquo; in reference to the wars
        fought by/against Voldemort, because they imply that there weren&rsquo;t other wizarding wars. It seems that
        many agree with me, because I don&rsquo;t see those terms used very often, but some people appear to be at a
        loss for what else to call it. For lack of anything that you like better, &ldquo;The War&rdquo; is honestly just
        fine. People have, for centuries, referred to different wars as &ldquo;The War.&rdquo; Using this name tells the
        reader not just how British wixes feel about Voldemort but also how they feel about Grindelwald. Either British
        wixes were largely insulated from Grindelwald&rsquo;s War or they think that Voldemort was <em>just that
            awful</em>. Which, honestly, he might&rsquo;ve been. You don&rsquo;t have to be very insulated from a
        foreign war in order for a civil war to fuck you up much worse.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you want something more detailed, the first approach is to go for a drab sort of name. Most wars have drab
        names: The Great War. The World War. The Civil War. For Merlin&rsquo;s sake, there are so many Civil Wars that
        people have to specify the country, and sometimes you still have to number them. Hell, you could say that civil
        wars are a bit of an English tradition, on par with the French preference for starting a new republic whenever
        things look dicey (they&rsquo;re up to No. 5, you know).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Lots of wars are named after their length. In this case, the First Wizarding war would be &ldquo;The Eleven Year
        War,&rdquo; though post-DH scholars would probably prefer &ldquo;The Twenty-Seven Year War&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
        Long War,&rdquo; and describe the peace from 1981 to 1995 as more of a lull. You can also name a war after a
        person, but it should be &ldquo;Voldemort&rsquo;s War,&rdquo; not &ldquo;the Voldemort War&rdquo; (though that
        name in particular probably wouldn&rsquo;t be used until after the second war.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sometimes you do get something a little poetic, though, like &ldquo;the Violence,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
        Anarchy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Troubles.&rdquo; I like the sound of the Confusion(s), the Disorder, the
        Disturbance, and especially the Shambles, which can refer to great disorder or ruin, to carnage and devastation,
        and to a slaughterhouse or meat market. If you&rsquo;d like to imply something about Voldemort&rsquo;s intention
        to cleanse Magical Britain, then consider &ldquo;the Lather,&rdquo; which can refer to both agitation and
        (cleansing, burning) soap. Outside Britain, you might hear it referred to as &ldquo;the Situation&rdquo; or
        &ldquo;the Difficulties,&rdquo; or something like that.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Seeing as revolutionaries start revolutions but the Death Eaters are more specifically
        &ldquo;reactionaries,&rdquo; you could probably get away with something like &ldquo;The Reaction.&rdquo; You
        could even go for &ldquo;The Pure-blood Reaction,&rdquo; though most wars tend to have simpler names and
        I&rsquo;d recommend this only if there were a previous Reaction which people might want to differentiate it
        from.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Basically, all names in fictional stories exist in two contexts: the fictional history of that setting, and the
        real world which the readers of that story inhabit. Names (of people, places, or anything else) need to make
        sense in the context of the fictional history and avoid inspiring the wrong response in the story&rsquo;s
        readers. For example, &ldquo;Han&rdquo; is an actual name that some people have, and so is &ldquo;Solo,&rdquo;
        but I would strongly recommend against naming a character &ldquo;Han Solomon&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hans Solo&rdquo;
        or anything similar, no matter how plausible it might be for a Dutch-Italian character to have that name, unless
        you are specifically intending for the reader to think about <em>Star Wars</em>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>On Reddit, Oltreeno <a

    <h1><a name="party" rel="nofollow" id="party"></a>Names for Political Parties <a href="#BackCat1"
            rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <p>If a political party is strongly associated with a particular region, then you could check Wikipedia&rsquo;s
        article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_flowers_of_the_United_Kingdom">county flowers of the
            United Kingdom</a>: there might be the Burnt-tip Party in Wiltshire, Papaver Rhoeas in Essex, or Primroses
        in Devonshire.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Chariot racing held an unusual degree of influence In the Byzantine or Eastern Roman Empire. By the 6th century
        the two dominant teams &ndash; Blues and Greens &ndash; and support for those teams had acquired political and
        religious significance, e.g. the Blues were associated with the wealthy and the Greens with the common
        masses.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Historical Political Parties</h2>
    <h3>Conservative Party</h3>
    <p>Coined by J. Wilson Croker in a magazine article. Later joined with the Liberal Unionists to become the
        Conservative and Unionist Party. Generally considered to descend from the Tories, and often called called Tories
        to this day.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the 1980s, a hardline faction of the Conservative Party referred to other members of the party as <em>wets
        </em>&ndash; the term &ldquo;wet&rdquo; being British slang for &ldquo;feeble, useless&rdquo; &ndash; and in
        short order were themselves labeled as &ldquo;dries.</p>
    <h3>Co-operative Party</h3>
    <p>Founded by Co-operatives UK, a British co-operative. They stand alongside Labour in an electoral alliance called
        the Labour and Co-operative Party.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Labour Party</h3>
    <p>Organized to represent and serve the interests of the working-class, i.e. labour.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Liberal Party</h3>
    <p>Adopted by Lord John Russell, leader of a coalition of Whigs and Radicals.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Liberal Unionist Party</h3>
    <p>Broke away from the Liberal Party, called &ldquo;Unionists&rdquo; for their support of the union of Ireland with
        the rest of the United Kingdom, and their opposition to Irish independence or even limited self-governance (not
        unlike what is called a &ldquo;devolved&rdquo; government today).&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Tories</h3>
    <p>The Tories were originally known as the Court Party. The term &ldquo;tory&rdquo; was originally an insult,
        derived from the Middle Irish <em>t&oacute;raidhe</em>, &ldquo;outlaw, robber&rdquo; (it is worth noting that
        the Tories as such organized around their support for King Charles, who was controversial for his support of the
        Roman Catholic Church).&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Whigs</h3>
    <p>Originally the Roundheads or Parliamentarians, the former in reference to a common hairstyle among the Puritans,
        that being closely-cropped or flat hair, and the latter in reference to their support of Parliament during the
        English Civil War; and then called the Country Party.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Their name negatively compared the Whigs to the radical Presbyterians who carried out the Whiggamore Raid of 1648
        in opposition to King Charles. &ldquo;Whiggamore&rdquo; itself was an English slur for western Scottish cattle
        drovers.&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bedford Whigs, or Bedfordites: John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Derby Dilly, or Stanleyites: Edward Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby; also the name of a stagecoach called the
            Derby Dilly. They merged with the Tories.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Foxite Whigs: Charles James Fox.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Rockingham Whigs, or Rockinghamites: Charles Watson-Wentworth, 2nd Marquess of Rockingham.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There were also Patriot Whigs, Philosophic Whigs, Radical Whigs,&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Color</h2>
    <p>The great magician Isaac Newton divided the color spectrum into seven primary colors: red, orange, yellow, green,
        blue, indigo, and violet, and the colors below have been organized into these groups, plus Black & White. Hex
        codes are included.</p>
    <p>Consider making use of adjectives to give additional color to these names. Some examples:&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The &ldquo;Blue-Greens&rdquo; are a merger of the Blues and Greens, after the manner of the Conservative and
            Unionist Party, Liberal Democrats, etc.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The &ldquo;Goldenrods&rdquo; are a Utopian party who want to reform the government. Nobody is formally
            called a &ldquo;Light&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dark&rdquo; Goldenrod, but these terms are often used (sometimes in
            contradictory ways) to describe how individual members fall on certain issues.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The Heliotropes formed at some point in the past, and their position on certain issues has largely shifted
            since that time. &ldquo;Old Heliotropes&rdquo; have not abandoned their party, but some or all of their
            values have not changed in tandem with their fellow travelers.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The &ldquo;French Violets&rdquo; were thus called because they were seen as insufficiently patriotic (at
            that time, the chief foe was Wizarding France). Because a number of them were indeed of French descent, they
            took the name with pride, and when a few of these were ejected from the Violets they formally organized
            themselves as the French-Violets.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Black &amp; White</h3>
    <p>Silver will tarnish over time, making it a &ldquo;light&rdquo; metal that darkens (Darkens) over time.&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class=bistre>⬤</span> #3D2B1F Bistre, Bister: Pigment made from beechwood soot.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=cream>⬤</span> #FFFDD0 Cream: First attested as a color name in 1590, and associated with
            dairy.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=jet>⬤</span> #343434 Jet: Refers to the color of a gemstone and type of low-grade coal. Because
            jet is a type of
            transmuted wood, it might be possible to use it as wandwood. As a name for a political party, I personally
            prefer &ldquo;Jet-Black&rdquo; to avoid bringing to mind jet engines, but that makes it sound like
            there&rsquo;s an association with the Black family (which may or may not be an extra selling point).&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li><span class=ivory>&nbsp;⬤&nbsp;</span> #FFFFF0 Ivory: First attested as a color name in 1385. Ivory is a
            shade of white, but
            it&rsquo;s associated with tusks and teeth, and sometimes used to describe the color of bones, all of which
            can have a Dark connotation, so it&rsquo;s on my shortlist of &ldquo;names for the political wing of the
            Death Eaters.&rdquo;</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Blue</h3>
    <p>Both the Celts and the French&sup1; were associated with blue.&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li><span class=cerulean>⬤</span> #007BA7 Cerulean: Refers to the blue of the sky; also called celestial blue
            and ceruleum. First attested
            as a color name in 1590.</li>
        <li><span class=glaucous>⬤</span> #6082B6 Glaucous: Used to refer to the camouflage coloring of some seabirds
            and marine animals, the
            protective coatings on some plants, and the eyes of Athena.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=periwinkle>⬤</span> #CCCCFF Periwinkle: Associated with blossoming friendships, calmness, ice,
            serenity, winter, and
            womanhood. Sometimes considered more violet than blue. First attested as a color name in 1922.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=zaffre>⬤</span> #0014A8 Zaffre, Zaffer: Deep blue pigment obtained by roasting cobalt ore, which
            is associated with kobolds, i.e. goblins. First
            attested as a color name
            in the 1550s.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>&sup1; A type of Celt.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Green</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class=celadon>⬤</span> #ACE1AF Celadon: First attested in 1768, referring to the color of greenware
            pottery imported from China.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=emerald>⬤</span> #50C878 Emerald: Associated with the secrets of alchemy.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=malachite>⬤</span> #0BDA51 Malachite: First attested as a color name in the 13th century. The
            ore and its color have been associated with death, new life, protection from lightning, and the sign of
            Capricorn&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li><span class=viridian>⬤</span> #40826D Viridian: First attested as a color name in the 1860s. From the Latin
            <em>viridis</em>,
            &ldquo;green.&rdquo;&nbsp;
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Indigo</h3>
    <p><span class=indigo>⬤</span> #4000FF. From the Latin <em>indicum</em>, &ldquo;Indian,&rdquo; because the original
        dye
        &ldquo;indigo&rdquo; was imported
        from India. In politics, it might refer to a party whose members are regarded as insufficiently
        &ldquo;British&rdquo; or patriotic, or otherwise too influenced by foreign interests.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It may also be associated with Isaac Newton, who was the first to use the word as a color term separate from the
        dye.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Orange</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span class=goldenrod>⬤</span> #DAA520 Goldenrod: Associated with new beginnings, prosperity, and
            resilience. The
            Church of Scientology
            prints &ldquo;suppressive person declarations&rdquo; on goldenrod-colored paper. Light Goldenrod: <span
                class=goldenrod-light>⬤</span> #FFEC8B.
            Dark Goldenrod: <span class=goldenrod-dark>⬤</span> #B8860B.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=saffron>⬤</span> #F4C430 Saffron: Saffron-colored cloth was used by the Irish and continues to
            be
            used in some
            situations.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=brown>⬤</span> #964B00 Brown: Typically a very dark orange.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Red</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span class=amaranth>⬤</span> #E52B50 Amaranth: Refers to the color of the amaranth flower, associated with
            health and immortality.</li>
        <li><span class=claret>⬤</span> #7F1734 Claret: First attested as a color name in 1547, most often referring to
            light-colored red wine,
            from the Latin <em>clarus</em>, &ldquo;clear,&rdquo; but also to blood.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span class=madder>⬤</span> #A50021 Madder: Named for the dye produced from plants of the genus
            <em>Rubia</em>.&nbsp;
        </li>
        <li><span class=vermillion>⬤</span> #E34234 Vermillion: First attested as a color name in 1289, ultimately from
            the
            Latin <em>vermiculus</em>,
            &ldquo;little worm.&rdquo; In some cases interchangeable with cinnabar.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Violet</h3>
    <p>Sometimes violet is a lighter purple, and sometimes it&rsquo;s synonymous with purple.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The word always makes me think of &ldquo;violent,&rdquo; maybe because I misread things a lot. Perhaps the
        &ldquo;Ultra-Violets&rdquo; are a radical faction within the Violets, and the political wing of the Death
        Eaters.&nbsp;</p>
