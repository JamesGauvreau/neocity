    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter is intended to assist with characters named after constellations and celestial bodies, like most of
        the Blacks. It covers all 88 modern constellations; all of the planets (plus Pluto) and all of the moons
        discovered by 1914; various stars, including the twenty brightest; and numerous asteroids.</p>

    <p>Where I don't have a preexisting English tradition to fall back on, names are described as masculine, feminine,
        or unisex according to their gender in the source language and their use in other European languages. Where I
        have found French and Latin variations of the English name, I give those as well in case you want them.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Constellations may be northern or southern, meaning that they are best viewed from that hemisphere, and either
        seasonal or circumpolar, meaning that they are either best viewed during a particular season or can be viewed
        well (from the right hemisphere) throughout the year. Seasonal constellations can be viewed from the opposite
        hemisphere during the opposing season, e.g. if you are in the southern hemisphere, then the best time to view a
        northern spring constellation is in autumn.</p>

    <p>If you really want to double-down on the theme, consider dropping “Senior and Junior” (Sr., Jr.) for “Major and
        Minor” (Mj., Mn.), and “the First, the Second, the Third” (I, II, III…) for “Alpha, Beta, Gamma…” (Α, Β, Γ… or
        α, β, γ…), e.g. “Sirius Black, Mn” or “Cygnus Black Γ.”</p>
