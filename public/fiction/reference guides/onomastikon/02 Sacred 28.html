    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter has no summary.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>You can do whatever you’d like, of course, but in case you want a little bit of historical grounding, I’ve dug
        into plausible etymologies and origins for the Sacred Twenty-eight. The map below (<a
            href="https://wmbsaltworks.neocities.org/images/reference_guide/Sacred28.png" rel="nofollow">full-size
            here</a>) portrays one possible geographic arrangement, but others are possible. </p>

    <p>Keep in mind that the term “Sacred Twenty-eight” was coined by Cantankerus Nott, in his book <em> The Pure-blood
            Directory</em>, which he wrote in the 1930s. It’s not an ancient term, it’s not a list of Wizengamot
        seat-holding families, and the inclusion of these names and exclusion of those names was influenced by personal
        opinion. For example, the Potters are believed to have been excluded not because they definitely had Muggle
        ancestry but on the basis that their name gave Cantankerus too many Muggly Vibes.</p>

    <p>If you’d like to know how the <em> Pure-blood Directory </em> reads, it’s plausibly something along the lines of
        <em> Burke’s Peerage</em>. The book’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burke%27s_Peerage" rel="nofollow">
            Wikipedia article </a> has links to more than twenty editions of <em> Burke’s Peerage</em>, from 1826 to
        1915, so you’ve got plenty of options no matter what kind of flavor you’d like to impart. </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Abbott</strong>
    </p>

    <p>May be derived from the O.E. <em>abbod</em> or French <em>abet</em>, both meaning “abbot; priest; father.” It may
        refer to a person’s behavior more than their station, or to their relationship (familial or otherwise) with an
        abbott. The name predates the Norman Conquest, and is found earliest in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and
        Oxfordshire.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Avery</strong>
    </p>

    <p>May derived from the Old French name Aubri, a form of <em>Alfred</em>, “elf counsel,” and the family may come
        from the county of Évreux, in Normandy. If so, they may be related to the Évreux cadet branch of the Capetian
        dynasty. The name is first attested in Northumberland, following the Norman Conquest. The name can also be
        derived from the Irish <em>aimhrea</em>, “doubt; speculation.”</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Black</strong>
    </p>

    <p>May be derived from the O.E. <em>blæc</em> or <em>blaca</em>, “black,” referring to someone dark-skinned (for a
        Briton, presumably) or dark-haired, but can also be derived from the M.E. <em>blac</em>, “pale, wan.” It can
        also be a translation of Scottish <em>dubh</em>, “dark, black.” It is said that the Blacks of Lincolnshire
        converted to Christianity in the early 7th century, and that a Scottish branch of these Blacks was established
        by the 13th century. The name may also be a shortened form of <em>Blacksmith</em>.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Bulstrode</strong>
    </p>

    <p>The name appears to originate from Buckinghamshire, where there is an estate of this name and names that refer to
        it. It may be derived from the O.E. <em>burh</em>, “fortress,” or <em>bula</em>, “bull,” and <em>strod</em>,
        “marsh,” the family predates the Norman Conquest, for it is said that the surname was bestowed by William the
        Conqueror, who was impressed by the original master of the estate. This is not to say that the wixen Bulstrodes
        are descended from that Bulstrode; they might as easily have been his tenants or simply living nearby.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Burke</strong>
    </p>

    <p>This name is a Normanization of the O.E. <em>burg</em>, “fortification,” and may be found in both England and
        Ireland, the latter through William de Burgo, a Norman.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Carrow </strong>
    </p>

    <p>May be derived from the O.E. <em>carr</em>, “rock,” and either <em>hōh</em>, “spur of a hill,” or <em>rāw</em>,
        “row,” most likely in Norfolk or Northumberland. It may also be derived from the Cornish <em>kerrow</em>, “forts
        (plural),” a common placename in Cornwall; or from the Welsh <em>caer</em>, “fort,” and <em>rhiw</em>, “hill,
        slope.” In Wales there is also the Carew Castle, built at the direction of Gerald de Winsor (thereafter de
        Carew) around the 12th century. May also be a variant of the French name Caron, from the Old French
        <em>charron</em>, “cartwright.”</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Crouch </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Probably derived to the M.E. <em>crouch</em>, “cross,” denoting someone who lives near a cross (this in turn was
        derived from the O.E. <em>crūc</em>, from the Latin <em>crux</em>). It may also refer to the River Crouch in
        Essex.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Fawley</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Probably refers to any of a number of communities called Fawley, which are most common in Berkshire,
        Buckinghamshire, Herefordshire, and Hampshire. It may be derived from the Old English <em>fealu</em>, “fallow
        color,” <em>fealh</em>, “plowed land,” and/or <em>leah</em>, “woodland clearing.” In Rowling’s novel <em>The
            Casual Vacancy</em>, there is also an aristocratic family by this name somewhere in the West Country,
        perhaps Herefordshire. The name may also be derived from the O.E. <em>fugulere</em>, “fowler.”</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Flint</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Probably an English toponym that refers to an outcropping of flint (or hard-hearted, flint-like person), but may
        also be Welsh, referring to the town of Flint, in Flintshire.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Gaunt</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Probably a Yorkshire variant of <em>Gant</em>, a toponym referring to the city of Ghent in Belgium, but may also
        be derived from the M.E. <em>gaunt</em>, “slim, slender,” or the French <em>gant</em>, “glove.”</p>

    <p>For what it’s worth, Little Hangleton is probably located in Yorkshire.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Greengrass</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Probably means just how it looks, but it could also be an anglicization of the Ashkenazic <em>Grünegras </em>or
        <em>Grönegräs </em>(which has the same meaning), or of the French <em>gingras</em>, “to dance.” If they are
        English, the Greengrasses almost certainly come from East Anglia, from whence all the earliest attestations
        come.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Lestrange</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Derived from the Middle French <em>estrange</em>, “foreign; odd, bizarre,” and the definite article <em>le</em>,
        which are combined to form <em>l’estrange</em>, “the foreign(er); the odd (one).” The earliest Lestranges in
        England are found in Norfolk, where they were called L’Estrange.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Longbottom </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Refers to the community of Luddenden Foot, West Yorkshire. It is derived from the O.E. <em>lang</em>, “long,” and
        <em>botm</em>,” valley bottom.”</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Macmillan </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Variant of McMillan, an Anglicization of the Scottish patronym <em>Mac Maoláin</em>, which is derived from
        <em>maol</em>, “bald, tonsured,” as in a tonsured priest. The Macmillans are associated with the community of
        Knapdale, in Argyll and Brute, and said to be descended from a 12th century married priest named Gille Chriosd.
        It is related to the Irish name McMullan, with the same connotations.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Malfoy</strong>
    </p>

    <p>Probably derived from the French <em>mal foi</em>, “bad faith,” but two alternatives are mentioned in “Potter Who
        and the Wossname’s Thingummy,” by ForrestUUID: that it is derived from <em>mal foie</em>, “bad (or sick) liver”;
        and that it is derived from millefeuille (roughly pronounced “mil-foy”), literally “thousand sheets” but
        referring to a dessert made of alternating layers of puff pastry and pastry cream. The earliest recorded use of
        the term only dates to the 18th century, but the pastry was probably invented at least two centuries earlier
        than that, if not even further back, and the Old French equivalent would have been <em>mile-fueille</em>, which
        is comparable. Perhaps the Malfoy name is evidence that Napoleon’s favorite pastry has a more ancient lineage
        than the Muggles suspect.</p>

    <p>If you’d like something a little less ridiculous, millefeuille is also a French name for the common yarrow,
        <em>Achillea millefolium</em>, otherwise known as the nosebleed plant, old man’s pepper, sanguinary, soldier’s
        woundwort, and thousand-leaf. It is worth noting that there is a French wizard Luc Millefeuille — rather
        reminiscent of “Lucius Malfoy” — who became notorious for poisoning muggles; perhaps they are related. As for
        “bad liver,” well, perhaps Malfoy le Premier had a drinking problem. Besides this, it is also a known variant of
        the Irish name Molloy, an Anglicization of the patronym Ó Maolmhuaidh, derived from <em>maol</em>, “youth,
        chieftain,” and <em>muad</em>, “noble, glorious.”</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Nott </strong>
    </p>

    <p>May be derived from the Old English <em>hnott</em>, “bald-headed, close-cropped.” It may also be a variant of
        <em>Knott</em>, derived from the M.E. <em>knotte </em>(O.E. <em>cnot</em>), “protrusion, bump,” in reference to
        a small hill, or boil, tumor, or wart, or (even more figuratively) to a short, thickset figure. Or perhaps it is
        derived from the Old Norse <em>nótt</em>, “night.”</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Ollivander </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Said to mean, “He who owns the olive wand.” The sign seen outside Ollivander’s shop says that the family has been
        making wands since 382 B.C. and Pottermore says that their original namesake came over with the Romans, but it’s
        more likely that the first Ollivander did not begin making wands much earlier than the 13th century, when
        <em>olive</em> displaced <em>elebēam </em>and <em>wand </em>(mostly) displaced <em>ġierd</em>. An earlier date
        may also suggest that the Ollivanders are responsible for the sense of <em>magic wand</em>, which is first
        attested in the 14th century.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Parkinson </strong>
    </p>

    <p>This is a patronym derived from the given name Parkin, which is a diminutive form of <em>Peter</em>, “stone,”
        most commonly found in Yorkshire and elsewhere in Northern England.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Prewett</strong>
    </p>

    <p>This is a Gloucestershire variant of Prewitt, which is derived from the Middle English <em>prou</em>,
        <em>preu</em>, or <em>prue</em>, “brave, valiant, proud” and ultimately from the Old French <em>proux</em>. It
        was introduced during the Norman Conquest.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Rosier </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Derived from the French <em>rosier</em>, “Rose bush,” and is especially associated with the Huguenots, a group of
        French Protestants who emigrated in the late 16th century and late 17th century to England (and elsewhere) due
        to their persecution in France.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Rowle </strong>
    </p>

    <p>May be derived from the O.E. <em>ruh</em>, “rough, overgrown,” and <em>leah</em>, “wood, clearing.” It may also
        be an Anglicization of the Irish Ó Roghallaigh, the meaning of which is unclear. According to <em>An
            etymological dictionary of family and Christian names</em>, published in 1857, Rowle may also be “Cornish
        British” for “rule, order, law,” but the exact root is not specified (a Cornish dictionary suggests
        <em>rowlys</em>). The same source also says that Rowle may be derived from the Welsh <em>rheol</em>, “rule,
        law,” but that word doesn’t show up in the Cornish</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Selwyn </strong>
    </p>

    <p>May be derived from the O.E. <em>sele</em>, “hall” or <em>sǣl</em>, “happiness, prosperity,” and <em>wine</em>,
        “friend,” or from the French <em>Salvagin</em>, “wild person.” In the latter case it would have been introduced
        by the Normans.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Shacklebolt </strong>
    </p>

    <p>May well be an entirely Wizarding name. FamilySearch reports only one case of a person surnamed “Shacklebolt,”
        with no recorded ancestry.</p>

    <p>Judging purely on relative population sizes in contemporary Britain, if the Shacklebolts were Muggles then they
        would be two or three times more likely to identify as Black Africans than Black Caribbeans. Both “shackle” and
        “bolt” are attested by the 15th century, and Africans were a notable minority population in some neighborhoods
        of London by the 17th century. Owing to the presence of Huguenots in these same communities, the Shacklebolts
        and Rosiers may be on good terms with each other.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Shafiq </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Both a given and family name in Arabic, and means “compassionate.”</p>

    <p>The Shafiqs are probably Pakistani; as a family name, “Shafiq” is most common in Pakistan, and Pakistanis are the
        second-largest ethnic minority group in the United Kingdom. Immigration from Pakistan to the United Kingdom was
        greatest following WWII, but the <em>Pure-blood Directory </em>was written in the 1930s. The Shafiqs probably
        arrived in Britain somewhen in the latter half of the 19th century, but Pakistani immigration began as early as
        the mid-17th century.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Slughorn </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Plausibly an old spelling of <em>slogan</em>, referring to a Scottish warcry, which might be featured in
        heraldry. It might also refer to a type of (fictional) wind instrument, but because the Slughorns are an old
        Pure-blood family and this latter meaning dates no further back than the 18th century, this seems unlikely.
        Whatever the case may be, it is not attested in the Muggle world.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Travers </strong>
    </p>

    <p>May be either English or Irish. The first form is derived from the Middle English <em>travers</em>, “toll;
        toll-taker,” and the latter from the Irish <em>Treabhair</em>, “skillful.” If the Travers family are English,
        then they probably came over with the Normans, for whom it was a topographic name referring to someone who lived
        at a crossing.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Weasley </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Derived from “weasel,” per word of God, but it’s worth noting that the name exists in the real world.
        FamilySearch suggests (without citation) that it is “probably an altered form” of the name Beasley, itself a
        variant of Bisley, which refers to various English locations by that name. If I had to bullshit an etymology, I
        would say that at some point a branch of the Beasley clan immigrated from the area of Bisley, Surrey to
        Devonshire in the west, whereupon they were referred to as the West Beasleys, and then later as the Weasleys. Or
        maybe it’s about weasels after all and any resemblance to “Beasley” is pure coincidence.</p>

    <p>
        <strong>Yaxley </strong>
    </p>

    <p>Derived from <em>ġēac</em>, “cuckoo,” and <em>lēah</em>, “clearing, meadow.” There are multiple English locations
        by that name, most notably in Cambridgeshire and Suffolk.</p>
