    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Unknown.  </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Causes the ears to shrivel up or wither.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Can be enchanted into hats. </p>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Emancipare. <strong>Taught in: </strong>7th Year Charms.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Unbars, unbinds, unlocks, unties, or otherwise removes obstacles to freedom.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The charm is broad in application but difficult to pull off, and will only
        work if the target object is <em>presently</em>  confining or impeding someone. It requires greater precision
        against spells. </p>

        Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Condidicarmen.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Hinders many spells and other attempts to detect the presence and nature of an
        enchantment. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>The breadth and strength of this spell depends very much upon the caster's
        knowledge: detection methods of which the caster is unaware are unlikely to be affected much or at all, and
        those which the caster understands in depth will be affected more severely. </p>

    <h2><a name="encouragementcharm" rel="nofollow" id="encouragementcharm"></a>Encouragement Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Hortaminis. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Inspires courage in the target. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>There are many flavors of courage: bravura, daring, fearlessness, spunk, and so
        forth. </p>

    <p><strong>Miscasting: </strong>The target is made more reckless than courageous.  </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The caster must feel courage, to some degree, in order to inspire it in
        others. It is easier to inspire the same kind of courage felt by oneself, but not necessary.  </p>

    <h2><a name="engorgementcharm" rel="nofollow" id="engorgementcharm"></a>Engorgement Charm</h2>

    <p>A.K.A. Growing Charm</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Engorgio. <strong>Light:</strong> Icy blue, as a circle which expands as it
        emanates. <strong>Taught in: </strong>2nd Year Charms (1985-86). </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Causes the target, or less commonly a part of the target, to swell immensely.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>If the target is made to swell too much, then it will explode. Can be a
        counter-charm for the Shrinking Charm. Can be enchanted into food. </p>

    <h2><a name="entrail-evacuatingcurse" rel="nofollow" id="entrail-evacuatingcurse"></a>Entrail-Evacuating Curse</h2>

    <p>A.K.A. Entrail-Expelling Curse</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Unimpedimento. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Expels blockages from the intestinal region via forced defecation (e.g. magical enema).
    </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Rather uncomfortable, and sometimes painful, but can be safer than simply
        Vanishing the blockage. Invented by Urquhart Rackharrow, a Healer, in the 1600s. Also called the
        Entrail-Expelling Curse.    </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s):</strong> Canon, with some elaboration.</p>
    <h2><a name="entrail-extractingcurse" rel="nofollow" id="entrail-extractingcurse"></a>Entrail-Extracting Curse</h2>

    <p>A.K.A. Entrail-Expelling Curse</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Fio extrailis, <em>Fio</em> meaning "become," as in "your entrails will become your
        extrails." </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Causes the target's intestines to exit their body—through the rectum, but preexisting
        abdominal wounds may be used as well</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>If performed with care, the Entrail-Extracting Curse will not cause irreparable
        damage, but a sloppy casting can inflict grievous trauma (including, but not limited to, tearing apart the
        stomach) and even kill the target. Needless to say, duelists prefer the sloppy version. It is also possible to
        merely cause abdominal pain or internal damage by causing the intestines to shift in place. There is a variant
        of this spell which weakens the abdominal tissue so that the intestines burst out as if tearing through gelatin.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Also called the Entrail-Expelling Curse. To make matters worse, this spell
        was <em>also</em> invented by Urquhart Rackharrow. Officially, this was meant to be a Healing Spell as well, and
        there actually are some (very rare) reasons to magically induce rectal prolapse, but Rackharrow was also known
        for his gambling debts, and it's safe to say that the Entrail-Extracting Curse has seen more use on the streets
        than at St. Mungo's. Can be enchanted into a waistcoast.   </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s):</strong> Canon, maybe, with significant elaboration. We know that there's an Entrail-Expelling
        Curse, but not what it does, so I split the difference: There's one that expels things from your entrails and
        another that actually expels your entrails. </p>

    <h2><a name="explosioncurse" rel="nofollow" id="explosioncurse"></a>Explosion Curse</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Expulso, meaning "to expel." <strong>Light:</strong> Blue.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Creates an explosion centered on a point in empty space.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The force of the explosion is generally sufficient to knock people down but
        usually doesn't cause significant tissue damage. It does not detonate objects. Modifying the light of this spell
        is rather simple. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s):</strong> Canon, with some elaboration (the spell’s light is different depending on your
        current character in the video games, so...why not?), including from <a href="http://wandw.wikidot.com/start"
            rel="nofollow">Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry</a>, and an incantation from the same source. </p>

    <h2><a name="extensioncharm" rel="nofollow" id="extensioncharm"></a>Extension Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Capacious Extremis. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Expands the internal dimensions of an object without affecting its external dimensions.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>If the caster is sufficiently skilled, a hundred people could be fit into a space
        the size of a toilet cubicle.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Objects in an Extended container are also made lighter, at least usually
        (it's not inconceivable that an improperly-cast Extension Charm might not provide this benefit). In Britain,
        Extension Charms are not permitted for the creation of permanent living spaces, but only to contain objects or
        to serve as <em>temporary</em> living spaces (e.g. tents). Bringing an Extended space into another Extended
        space is dangerous. </p>

    <h2><a name="extinguishingcharm" rel="nofollow" id="extinguishingcharm"></a>Extinguishing Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Deflammo. <strong>Taught in: </strong>6th Year Charms (1989-90). </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Extinguishes a target fire, or prevents a fire from being lit. </p>
