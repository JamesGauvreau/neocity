    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter has no summary.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>The wand in its modern form was not invented until the 13th century and did not become widespread until the
        Renaissance, which was a period of experimentation and new styles for wixes just as much as for muggles.  </p>

    <p>In lieu of wands, many Medieval European spells depended on astronomical phenomena, occult material
        correspondences, and other circumstances. One advantage that Medieval European magic holds over the modern
        wand-based paradigm is that it is almost impossible to perform the spell incorrectly so long as the spell's
        requirements — called "bans and demands" — are met. </p>
    <h2>Binding of Astarot</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Habenihil Ampt, a blend of German and Latin that roughly means "Stop working." </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Paralyzes the target by locking up the muscles in their limbs, not unlike the <span
            class="caps">Leg-locker Curse</span>. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The Binding is a Medieval European spell that predates the widespread use of
        wands. Like many spells of its era, it has unusual requirements that play much the same role as a wand, albeit
        by a different method. </p>

    <p><strong>Bans &amp; Demands: </strong>The Binding of Astarot may only be performed in the period following sunset
        and the appearance of Venus, and before sunrise. Its efficacy is greatest at those times when Venus is most
        bright and the Moon is a full crescent. If cast before midnight, the caster must point two fingers to the west;
        if after, then to the east. The caster may not wear leather. As an enchantment, it must be laid in caracteres or
        runes of honey or horse's blood, applied with two fingers to a non-leather material under the same astrological
        conditions mentioned before, but afterwards the enchantment will serve at any time.    </p>

    <h2>Blessing of Saint Veronica</h2>

    <p><b>Incantation: </b>Beppnniknettani.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Protects against elfish jinxes.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>House-elves typically don't jinx or curse people, but Yumboes and (more
        relevantly, for European wixes) Erklings most certainly do. Like many Medieval European spells, Saint Veronica's
        Blessing has unusual requirements that play much the same role as a wand, albeit by a different method. </p>

    <p><strong>Bans &amp; Demands: </strong>Most effective when embroidered into linen or silk, and when performed
        between the Summer Solstice and the following Full Moon. Whether incanted or enchanted, the spell must be
        performed between two mirrors that face each other, and then the caster must make a sacrifice of blood. If the
        spell has been enchanted into an object, then this blood must be wiped across the surface of the object. </p>

    <h2>Cannon's Bane</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Saulebis Quidepersequeris.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Banishes the target projectile in a particular direction (typically up, sideways, or in
        reverse). This only works against sufficiently fast-moving objects, such as a cannonball; one must take care to
        actually perform the spell <em>before</em> anything is fired. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The Cannon's Bane is a 15th century spell and has been almost completely
        superseded by the <span class="caps">Extinguishing Charm</span>, which likewise protects against firearms but
        requires less precision (and timing!) and has other practical uses, which means that it is more likely to be
        known in the first place. In modern times, the spell is merely a curiosity, used only by those who delight in
        its collateral damage. A variant of this spell was briefly used in Quidditch and Quodpot, but has since been
        banned. </p>

    <p><strong>Source: </strong>Original.  </p>
    <h2>Invocation of Joshua</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Schemesamatia.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Prevents a light source from dimming, or rather prevents the light from fading even if
        the light source weakens or moves away. </p>

    <p><strong>Bans &amp; Demands: </strong>Most efficacious when light is already dimming or receding, as in the "blue
        hours" when the Sun has dipped below the horizon, and when Saturn and the Sun are in conjunction. Each
        recitation of the incantation must be followed by four fingersnaps, and the duration of the spell (all other
        factors being equal) may be lengthened by additional recitations. Though iron is generally a difficult metal to
        enchant, it is easier to lay this spell on iron than any other metal. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong>The Lesser Key of Solomon, with significant elaboration. </p>
    <h2>Name of Sinai</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Hacedion.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Dismisses feelings of sorrow from the target. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>In Jewish and Christian wizarding tradition, the Name of Sinai is one of the
        names of God, which was given to Moses on Mount Sinai. Comparable to the <span class="caps">Cheering
            Charm</span>, except that it does not <em>produce</em> feelings.</p>

    <p><strong>Bans &amp; Demands: </strong>Unlike many other premodern spells, the Name of Sinai does not have "bans
        and demands" as such, but does require a certain kind of meditative focus, which was often obtained through
        ritual practice. </p>
    <h2>Orison of Saint Kacochilla</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Sanctus Kakukakilla. The incantation must be made four times. Upon each
        incantation, the caster must brandish their pseudo-wand (see below) in one of the four cardinal directions,
        beginning with the west and proceeding clockwise. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>The immediate area becomes displeasing to rats and mice, who will withdraw as soon as
        they are not in immediate danger (it will not be more displeasing to them than the prospect of being eaten by an
        owl). </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The Orison of Saint Kacochilla is a Late Medieval European spell that
        predates the widespread use of wands. Many Medieval European spells depended on astronomical phenomena, obscure
        material correspondences, and so forth, but the Orison of Saint Kacochilla is distinguished more by its use of a
        "pseudo-wand," which requires less preparation than the modern wand but is vastly more limited.  </p>

    <p><strong>Pseudo-wand: </strong>This spell requires the remex (flight feather, pl. remiges) of a pigeon, which
        cannot have been obtained by violence: either the pigeon must consent to the removal of their feather or the
        feather must be obtained after the pigeon has naturally lost it. If runes are scribed to lay this spell as an
        enchantment, then the remex must be used as a quill, the ink cannot be blood, and the runes must be written out
        on four separate objects, placed in alignment with the cardinal directions at the perimeter of the area to be
        enchanted. Most remiges will function only a few times before they must be replaced. </p>
