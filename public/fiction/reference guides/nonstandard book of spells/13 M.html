    <h2><a name="mechanicallockingcharm" rel="nofollow" id="mechanicallockingcharm"></a>Mechanical Locking Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Declaustrum.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Activates an existing mechanical lock, regardless of its complexity. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The lock is sealed non-magically, meaning that keys and lockpicks will be
        sufficient to open it. </p>

    <p><b>Incantation: </b>Unknown. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Makes the target's hair try to strangle them.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The curse is difficult to lift, but can be dealt with indirectly by cutting
        off the target's hair.</p>

    <h2><a name="memoryextractioncharm" rel="nofollow" id="memoryextractioncharm"></a>Memory Extraction Spell</h2>

    <p>A.K.A. Memory-extracting Charm. </p>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Animus Exorire.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Withdraws a memory in physical form.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>It is possible to withdraw another person's memories by means of this spell, but
        much more difficult. Using it on an unwilling target is also possible, but sufficiently difficult that it is
        nearly always more practical to use Legilimency and then withdraw one's own memories. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Memories are withdrawn in the form of "Mneme," a light, fragile, and highly
        soluble silver-colored substance that will adhere to the wand until the caster's concentration breaks. Under
        most circumstances, Mneme dissipates into the air unless quickly jarred or otherwise contained. If cast
        wandlessly, Mneme will typically exit the body through the eyes or another orifice. The use of this spell will
        moderately impair the target's personal recollection, but viewing of the extracted memory in a Pensieve will
        address this. Mneme is more easily affected by the <span class="caps"><a href="67386586#falsememorycharm"
                rel="nofollow">False Memory Charm</a></span> than memories that are still held inside a living mind.

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong>Something like this must clearly exist in canon, but the details have been filled out

    <h2><a name="mendingcharm" rel="nofollow" id="mendingcharm"></a>Mending Charm</h2>

    <p>A.K.A. Repairing Charm, Object-mending Charm</p>

    <p><b>Incantation: </b>Reparo. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Fixes a broken object.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Other charms are required to undo the effects of natural weathering or restore the
        magical functions of a broken object. When applied to the same object on multiple occasions, the Mending Charm
        becomes less effective. If used on living creatures, it can result in scarring or other disfigurement, so it is
        illegal to do so.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>May be specified as the Object-Mending Charm, to avoid confusion with the
        <span class="caps">Knit-Up Charm</span> (which is sometimes referred to as the Mending Charm). Requires
        visualization of the repair.

    <h2><a name="mufflingcharm" rel="nofollow" id="mufflingcharm"></a>Muffling Charm</h2>

    <p><b>Incantation: </b>Muffliato. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Produces a mild buzzing sound in the ears of nearby listeners, which covers up
        conversations being held between the caster and anyone who has been excluded from the charm's effect.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>The natural tendency of a voice is to be heard, and so this tendency must be
        opposed by the spell and the caster's will. Those that are figuratively soft-spoken will find the spell easier
        than those that are boisterous, regardless of their actual volume. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong>Canon, with original incantation and some elaboration from myself and <a

    <h2><a name="muggle-repellingcharm" rel="nofollow" id="muggle-repellingcharm"></a>Muggle-repelling Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Repello Muggletum.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Muggles are unable to see the enchanted area or object for what it is — typically
        perceiving ruins and decay instead — and if they attempt to enter or interact with it, they suddenly remember
        some pressing engagement elsewhere. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>It is possible to alter how Muggles perceive the enchanted area or object, and what
        they feel upon trying to enter or interact with it. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong>Canon. </p>
    <h2><a name="multi-shotjinx" rel="nofollow" id="multi-shotjinx"></a>Multi-Shot Jinx</h2>

    <p><b>Incantation: </b> Palmatefy, a portmanteau of <em> palmate </em> (an extended reference to the duck’s foot
        gun) and <em> stupefy</em>. <strong>Light: </strong>Red.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Fires multiple Stunning bolts, after the manner of the Stunning Charm.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Rather tricky to cast—often simpler to just cast multiple Stunning Charms.
        Classified as a “jinx” because there’s no practical use for it outside of duels.</p>
