    <h2>Ignition Hex</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Lacarnum Inflamari. <strong>Light: </strong>Orange. <strong>Taught in: </strong>5th
        year DADA. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Sets the (non-living) target object on fire, especially clothing.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Classified as a hex because it is designed to get around Fire-Proofing
        Charms. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s):</strong> Canon, with some elaboration.</p>
    <h2><a name="illegibilitycharm" rel="nofollow" id="illegibilitycharm"></a>Illegibility Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Illegibilus. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Makes a written passage impossible to read.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Often used to encode messages which can only be “re-legiblized” with a
        particular counter-incantation. Sufficiently powerful counter-charms can still break the enchantment but a
        skilled wix can leave a particular distinctive pattern (perhaps the numerical values of the fourth, twelfth, and
        twenty-ninth letters in any encoded message will add up to a specific sum) that is not in itself magical, so a
        snooping intermediary will need to know both (1) the checksum and (2) the original caster’s variation on the
        Illegibility Charm in order to properly re-encode the message in a manner which will hide the fact their
        intrusion. The Voynich Manuscript is the product of a (yet-unbroken) Illegibility Charm of great power.</p>

    <p>A.K.A. Freezing Charm</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Immobulus.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Freezes the target in its tracks.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>It is possible to immobilize multiple targets at once, if they are close to
        each other.</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Impedimenta. <strong>Light:</strong> Turquoise.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Slows, stops, or even pushes back against the target</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>May throw the target backwards. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Effects are not long-lasting. Can freeze a wasp in mid-air but seems useless
        against acromantulas, blast-ended skrewts, and lethifolds.</p>

    <h2>Imperio</h2>

    <h2><a name="imperiuscurse" rel="nofollow" id="imperiuscurse"></a>Imperius Curse</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Imperio. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Places the target under the control of the caster, by suppressing their will beneath the
        caster's.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>There are anti-Imperius countermeasures, but they are generally stationary
        (e.g. Thief's Downfall) or take some time to kick in (e.g. prolonged Dementor exposure). The strongest defense
        against the Imperius is that it's just plain hard to perform, especially at scale. Imperius'd wixes can Imperius
        other wixes, but it's <em>very</em> difficult to pull that off: not only are you suppressing the wills of two
        people at once, but you're trying to suppress the second with the first, and if someone doesn't have the
        strength to resist you then they're unlikely to have the strength to dominate someone else. Some wixes take a
        different approach. Rather than overpower the victim's will, they try to charm the victim in a muggle sense,
        using the Imperius Curse to create a mental connection and make the victim a little more impressionable, and
        then presenting the "command" as though it's the victim's own idea. This has its own limitations, of course, and
        it, too, becomes more difficult as you add links to the chain (though less quickly). Other mind-altering charms
        cannot be used through, and are broken by, the Imperius Curse. </p>

    <h2><a name="imperturbablecharm" rel="nofollow" id="imperturbablecharm"></a>Imperturbable Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Impervius. <strong>Taught in: </strong>4th year Charms. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Creates an invisible barrier around an object, such as a door or pair of glasses, which
        repels minor disruptions like lightly-thrown objects, noises, and water.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Can be specialized for specific elements or materials. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>It is no help against a serious attempt at intrusion, even by non-magical
        methods. When cast on a person, typically affects clothing but not held objects. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s):</strong> Canon, with some elaboration from myself and from <a
            href="https://www.hogwartsishere.com/courses/by-level/" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts is Here</a>. There’s an
        “Imperturbable Charm” and an “Impervius” incantation, whose effects have a certain similarity to each other.

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>With reference to a set of documents, conjures a list of those documents.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Can be adapted to index specific items, e.g. every occurrence of the word "indigo,"
        or a series of specific items, e.g. every occurrence of a color word, with page numbers grouped into the seven
        Newtonian Colors and every other color word redirecting to the closest appropriate Newtonian Color.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Removes all hair from the target.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>The caster's wand emits a quiet alarm when the target threshold is crossed. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Characteristics of the alarm (e.g. duration, tone, volume) may be modified. The
        default alarm is a soft hum seven seconds in length, which even the caster may fail to notice if they are
        distracted.</p>

        and put creases in the right places. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>The caster's wand may be used in place of a flatiron. The spell may be used to
        enchant Self-Ironing Robes. </p>
