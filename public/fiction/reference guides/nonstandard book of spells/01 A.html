    <h2><a name="agelinecharm" rel="nofollow" id="agelinecharm"></a>Age Line Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Anno Invius. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Prevents individuals below a specific age from crossing a specific point or entering a
        specific area. Might be able to prevent individuals <em>above</em> a specific age from doing the same.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Relies on calendar age, not physical age. Might be a jinx, if it also
        inflicts an effect on someone who tries to cross it, but the spontaneous beards exhibited by Fred and George
        Weasley (and two others) might have been the result of a second spell and/or been produced by an interaction
        with the Ageing Potion that they used. </p>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Unknown. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Thickens the air in the target space, so that it is noticeably difficult to move through
        it, as though one were moving through something closer to a liquid than a gas.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The thickened air is generally still breathable. </p>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Abecedarium. <strong>Light: </strong>none.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Alphabetizes books and other labeled objects (or even unlabeled objects, if cast with
        precision).</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>With precision, unlabeled objects may be alphabetised as well. </p>

    <h2>Amplifying Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Sonorus. <strong>Light: </strong>none. <strong>Taught in: </strong>3rd year Charms
        (1986-87). </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Amplifies the target sound, or sound produced by the target.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Almost no concentration is required when touching the target.  </p>

    <h2><a name="anti-apparitioncharm" rel="nofollow" id="anti-apparitioncharm"></a> Anti-Apparition Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Potest Intoir. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Put generally, an Anti-Apparition Charm prevents anyone from safely Apparating into the
        warded space.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Possible effects include displacing the traveler to another location, forcefully
        bouncing them back, or splinching them. Some Anti-Apparition Charms intentionally provide a "warning signal" of
        some kind, and others are intentionally "quiet" but may nevertheless be noticed ahead of time by a
        sufficiently-aware would-be traveler. It is simpler to cast upon an enclosed space, or at least a space that has
        been "delimited" or marked out (e.g. chalk circle).</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Cast on Hogwarts and the grounds thereof to prevent Apparition, but regularly
        lifted in order to permit Apparition lessons by Sixth-Year students. Distinct from the Anti-Disapparition
        Jinx. Does not apply to House-Elf Apparition. Might not apply to Goblin Apparition. </p>

    <p><strong>Source: </strong>Canon, with some elaboration from <a
            href="https://www.hogwartsishere.com/courses/by-level/" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts is Here</a> and myself. </p>
    <h2><a name="anti-cheatingspell" rel="nofollow" id="anti-cheatingspell"></a>Anti-Cheating Spell</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Unknown. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Quills may be bewitched to prevent cheating, which apparently includes "copying off
        other people's exams."</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Unclear whether there are multiple kinds of Anti-Cheating Spell, whether they
        can be applied to objects other than quills (e.g. on exam parchment), etc.  </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong>Canon.</p>

    <h2>Anti-Choking Charm (Manual Variation)</h2>

    <p>See <span class="caps">Dislodging Charm.</span></p>
    <h2>Anti-Choking Charm (Vanishing)</h2>

    <p>A.K.A. Airway-clearing Charm. <strong>Learned in: </strong>Unknown, but used by a 5th year during the 1988-89
        school year.</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong> Anapneo, meaning "I breathe."</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>A kind of Vanishing Spell which only works properly in a living body, because that body
        helps to set the limits of the spell. When cast properly, the Anti-Choking Spell removes all foreign matter from
        a particular region of the body—typically the throat, but the skilled practitioner can use it to clear other
        parts of the body as well. </p>

    <p><strong> Source(s): </strong> Canon, with some elaboration. </p>

    </p>
    <h2>Anti-Disapparition Jinx</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Unknown. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Prevents or otherwise disrupts Disapparition. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Some modifications may dislocate would-be Disapparitionists to a particular
        location (e.g. beside the caster) rather than block Disapparition entirely. Most competent wixes can cover 1,000
        square feet (roughly a 2-3 bedroom house in the U.K.) with a single application of the spell, especially if it
        is an enclosed space. It will usually last for a few hours, but with greater skill and technique can preserve it
        for much longer, while a sloppy casting might wear off in ten or fifteen minutes. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Cast on Hogwarts and the grounds thereof to prevent Disapparition, but
        regularly lifted in order to permit Apparition lessons by Sixth-Year students. Does not apply to House-Elf
        Disapparition. Might not apply to Goblin Disapparition. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong>Canon, with significant elaboration. </p>

    </p>
    <h2>Anti-Intruder Jinx</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Unknown.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Mechanism and effects unknown, though at least one kind of Anti-Intruder Jinx would, it
        was implied, prevent Harry Potter from climbing the Entrance Gates at Hogwarts after it were applied in Harry's
        Sixth Year.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Might refer to a whole category of spells. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong>Canon.</p>

    </p>
    <h2>Anti-Unlocking Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Obstructus Impervium.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Protects the target lock against spells which might unlock it.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Alone, the charm is only moderately useful, but for every form of unlocking spell
        there is (at least in theory) a variation of the Anti-Unlocking Charm that is tailored specifically to that
        spell. With sufficient knowledge and patience, as well as proper technique, it is possible to make a lock
        impregnable against every unlocking spell the caster can imagine—but no more than that. </p>

    </p>
    <h2>Antler-Growing Jinx</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Anteoculatia, from Spanish <em>ante</em>, meaning "buckskin" and
        Latin <em>oculas</em>, meaning "eyes." <strong>Light: </strong>Red or purple.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Causes large horns to grow from the target's head.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Possibly takes a long time to treat, because Pansy Parkinson missed a day's
        worth of classes after she was hit by this spell.  </p>

    </p>
    <h2>Apparition</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>None. <strong>Signs: </strong>Creates an audible noise, anywhere from a small pop
        to a loud crack; personal physical discomfort.  </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Causes the user to travel instantly from one location to another. Requires that the user
        mentally focus on the desired location (i.e. Destination, Determination, and Deliberation). </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Becomes more difficult with distance, and inter-continental Apparition is
        discouraged. It is possible to bring someone with you when Apparating, which is called Side-Along Apparition.  
    </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>It is probable that one must have been to a location before in order to
        Apparate there effectively.  Most people vomit the first time they Apparate, and the general discomfort
        associated with it may be why many wixes prefer other methods of travel. </p>

    <h2>Arrow-shooting Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Sagitto, meaning "shoot arrows" or "wound by arrows."  </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Conjures an arrow from the end of one's wand, at great velocity. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong>There is an arrow-shooting spell in canon, but the incantation is original.</p>

    <p>A.K.A. Ascending Charm, Propelling Charm, Propulsion Charm</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Ascendio. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Lifts the caster high into the air; or, in water, propels the caster to the surface. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Miscasting: </strong>Properly cast, this spell will allow the caster to return to the ground unharmed,
        but novices are likely to injure themselves if not monitored. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>This charm cannot be used to influence the caster's flight path after taking
        off. </p>
