    <p><b>Incantation: </b> Infragilus. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Makes the target object unbreakable by non-magical means.</p>

    <h2><a name="undetectableextensioncharm" rel="nofollow" id="undetectableextensioncharm"></a>Undetectable Extension
        Charm</h2>

    <p><b>Incantation: </b> Grandio Intus. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Enchants the target container to be bigger on the inside than on the outside, while the
        weight of the contents remains proportional to the original size, with the additional benefit that the contents
        are undetectable by anyone but the caster and others that have been told about the charm.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Most objects enchanted with this charm have an enlarged capacity between two
        and five times greater than normal (more is possible, but the difficulty of enchantment increases faster than
        the capacity, so it is usually more practical (and less expensive) to have two handbags. It is difficult to Apparate into a space affected by this charm, greatly increasing the risk of getting splinched. Extension charms of any sort are difficult (but not impossible) to combine with levitation spells.</p>
