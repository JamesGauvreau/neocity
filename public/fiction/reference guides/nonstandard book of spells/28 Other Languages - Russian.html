    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter has no summary.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Russian spells are more commonly referred to by the last word of their incantation (e.g. Tynetut, Vlomus). Their
        British-style names are often derived from nicknames, which may actually be unfamiliar to most of the people who
        use those spells. For example, Otbrykus is not referred to by any other name per se but is frequently
        <em>described</em> as "a spell for killing <em>zveri</em>" — animals, or rather <em>brutes</em>. Hence,
        Brute-slaying Curse. </p>

    <p>Traditional Slavic magic is light on magical focuses; careful fingering takes the place of wand strokes. The
        Russian system is a hybrid which combines Slavic finger-work with intricately crafted "spellwork rings"
        (заклина́ние пе́рстни, zaklinánije pérstni), each of which is a magical focus. Spellwork rings are too small to
        be as broadly useful as a wand, but a single ring might function well enough for a single spell, and several
        rings in combination are usually an adequate focus for a group of related spells. Any given set of rings will
        alter the necessary finger-work of a spell because this combination will focus the magic in one way, and that
        combination will focus it in another. Because no two Russian wixes will be wearing the same rings (much less
        wearing them on the same fingers), the finger-work of any particular individual will grow increasingly
        idiosyncratic as time goes on. Russians have a reputation for understanding their spells very deeply, because
        they must be aware of how to cast a spell when they are wearing these or those rings.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, this means that Russians remain rather isolated from advances in the wider world. Even in
        their own community it can be hard to "translate" a newly-discovered spell into a form that is usable for
        others, because no two Russians cast their spells in exactly the same way. Western-style wands are a fairly
        popular supplement for this reason, but their use is eschewed by Koldovstoretz and the Pure-bloods who run the
        school, and wand-bearers are usually on the shortlist of suspected traitors whenever xenophobia rules the day.
        For these reasons, Russian wandsmithing is a crude trade and the average Russian's wandwork would score somewhat
        poorly on a British O.W.L.      </p>
    <h2>Brute-slaying Curse</h2>

    <p>A.K.A. Otbrykus</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Koronale Mortale Otbrykus | Коронале Мортале Отбрыкус.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Repeatedly tightens the coronary arteries of the target, leading to a spasm of the
        arteries and subsequently a heart attack; the sensation of tightening is not unlike fingers closing around one's
        heart. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Death is usually the outcome, especially without magical assistance. While
        traces of the spell remain to be found in the body for days to come, non-magical analyses will identify the
        cause of death as ordinary cardiac arrest. For this reason, it is the preferred method of killing Muggles
        (лопухоиды, Lopukhoidy, sometimes translated as "Moronoids," and otherwise called zveri, "animals, brutes"). 
    </p>
    <h2>Fire-Spitting Hex</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Iskris Frontis, from Russian и́скриться (ískritʹsja), “to spark,” and фронт
        (front), “battle front.” </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Burns living things, sets non-living things afire, and applies kinetic force to whatever
        the light hits.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>The strength of the spell depends on the caster’s emotional intensity, but the fire
        it creates is more manageable than Fiendfyre and, unlike the Cruciatus Curse, specific emotions are not
        required, only intensity.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The spell is capable of knocking holes in walls.</p>

    <h2>Flicking Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Hap-tsap. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Moves the target object in a certain direction, according to the direction and speed of
        the wand movement. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Object may move quickly enough to cause harm or be damaged itself.</p>

    <p><strong>Source(s):</strong> <em>Tanya Grotter</em>, with slight elaboration.</p>
    <h2>Memory Charm (Russian)</h2>

    <p><b>Incantation:</b> Sklerotikus marazmatikus, from the Russian склеро́з (skleróz), “memory loss” and мара́зм
        (marázm), “undernourishment” or “idiocy.” </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Removes particular memories from the target.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Unlike the Memory Charm employed in Britain, the memory loss is not
        immediate. Indeed, the effect does not begin until the target is no longer thinking of the matter in question.
        However, the effect is harder to notice, and the spell works itself on close associations as well, which can be
        useful in many different circumstances: if the memory is recorded in a journal then the location of the journal
        will be forgotten, and if it was a logical deduction which might be made again then the facts required for that
        deduction will also be forgotten. These details don't even have to be known to the caster; the spell seeks and
        eliminates them without need for direction. Unfortunately, the Russian Memory Charm can sometimes be too
        aggressive: someone who initially lost their memory of a dog might forget about every dog they have ever seen
        and indeed the fact that dogs exist at all, and removing a particular arithmantic formula might rob someone even
        of their knowledge of long division. Very, very rarely, the memory loss will not cease until the target has
        forgotten everything they have ever known.</p>

    <h2>Soul-severing Spell</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation: </strong>Kaput Tynetut.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Separates the soul from the body, with an effect similar to the Dementor's Kiss (with
        the obvious difference that, as this is separation and not consumption, the soul presumably proceeds through the
        Veil). </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Rigorous and unethical experimentation by the Dark Lady of Novosibirk
        established that ghosts are far less likely to arise when a body is killed following the application of this
        spell. In Russia, the Soul-severing Spell is listed in the Stozapzaklin, the One Hundred Forbidden Spells. </p>

    <p><strong>Source(s): </strong><em>Tanya Grotter</em>, with some elaboration.</p>
    <h2>Spell-reflecting Charm</h2>

    <p><b>Incantation: </b> Vozvratus Otpravitelyus, from the Russian возврати́ться (vozvratítʹsja), “to return, to come
        back” and отправи́тель (otpravítelʹ), “sender.” Generally translated as “return to sender.” </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Functions much like the <span class="caps">Shield Charm</span>, except that spells which
        impact the Spell-Reflecting Charm (and do not penetrate it) are, as the incantation suggests, reflected back at
        their caster (or other targets, if the spell is angled right).</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The spell is much trickier than the Shield Charm, which is already tricky to
        perform, and waxes and wanes in popularity on the dueling circuits. It is primarily taught in Russia, where it
        was invented.</p>
