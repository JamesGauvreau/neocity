    <h2><a name="babblingcurse" rel="nofollow" id="babblingcurse"></a>Babbling Curse</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Garrulus. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Causes uncontrollable babbling.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>This spell may not actually exist (the in-text source is Lockhart).</p>

    <p><strong>Source(s):</strong> Canon, with incantation from <a href="http://wandw.wikidot.com/start"
            rel="nofollow">Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry</a>.</p>

    <h2>Banishing Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Depulso. <strong>Light:</strong> Red or white. <strong>Taught in: </strong>4th
        year.</p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Sends both objects and living things away from the caster, or "banishes" them.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Heavier objects may require greater precision or a deeper understanding of the
        charmwork, but with quick reflexes it is simpler to Banish an object in the process of being Summoned. With
        precision, it is possible to vary the direction and destination of the object, or banish unseen objects. One
        ought to concentrate on the desired outcome while casting this spell. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The spell is easily deflected, but can be more effective if the target is
        distracted (e.g. by casting their own spell), so it's an effective parry. It interrupts casting, creates
        distance, and provides space for a follow-up spell. Incorrect timing, however, can leave the caster open. </p>

    <h2><a name="barriercharm" rel="nofollow" id="barriercharm"></a>Barrier Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Saeptum. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Delays entry into rooms by locking, fortifying, and otherwise obstructing entrances. 
    </p>

    <p><strong>Countering: </strong>The effects are breakable by Unlocking Charms, hexes, and occasionally even physical
        force. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Increasingly-skilled casters are capable of increasingly-formidable barriers, but
        there comes a point when one is skilled enough that other spells are more attractive. </p>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Avis. <strong>Light: </strong>Blue. <strong>Other signs: </strong>Production of
        smoke; loud blast like the sound of a gunshot. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Conjures a bird or flock of birds from the tip of the caster's wand.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>With skill and understanding, many different kinds of birds can be produced, with
        or without a lengthened incantation.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>One of the two easiest living conjurations.</p>

    <h2><a name="bluebellflamescharm" rel="nofollow" id="bluebellflamescharm"></a>Bluebell Flames Charm</h2>

    <p>A.K.A. Cold Fire Charm, Friendfyre.</p>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Benthium. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Conjures “Bluebell Flames,” which are bright blue, waterproof, and almost completely
        harmless.</p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>Bluebell Flames can be touched without harming flesh, and even handled and
        placed in objects, but can singe clothing and plants. They are waterproof and do not give off noticeable heat.
        As a magical flame, they are not always appropriate for potions, and even their light can have an adverse effect
        on sensitive concotions. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Proficient casters can mentally direct the movement of the flame.</p>

    <p><strong>Miscasting: </strong>May be difficult to maintain under stress. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>It is possible to physically penetrate and disrupt the bubble, which, owing
        to the difficulty of incanting underwater, means that you're likely to drown if you're incapable of nonverbal
        casting. </p>

            href="https://www.hogwartsishere.com/" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts is Here</a>, as well as elaboration from
