    <h2><a name="falsememorycharm" rel="nofollow" id="falsememorycharm"></a>False Memory Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Mnemos. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Implants a false memory or alters an existing memory.</p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>Competent casters will typically be able to alter a few minutes, perhaps an hour at
        most, and will find it difficult to convincingly alter a memory concerning something of great important to the
        target, but these are soft limits that don't fail outright so much as fail to hold up under examination. Careful
        memory-crafting takes time (typically one minute of preparation per minute of memory) but Obliviators and others
        who intended to use the spell on a frequent basis will create "templets" that require only a little
        personalization. </p>

    <p><strong>Miscasting: </strong>More interesting failures are also possible: impairing the target's memory (or their
        ability to form new memories) outright, twisting the implanted memory into unintended memories, etc. This is one
        of the reasons that students aren't simply given false memories of instruction. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>The False Memory Charm is reversible. Not to be confused with the Memory
        Charm, which erases memories, though both are equally important tools for an Obliviator.</p>

    <h2><a name="feather-lightcharm" rel="nofollow" id="feather-lightcharm"></a>Feather-Light Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Perfusorius. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Makes the target as light as a feather.</p>

    <p><strong>Source(s):</strong> Canon, with an incantation from <a href="http://wandw.wikidot.com/start"
            rel="nofollow">Witchcraft &amp; Wizardry</a>.</p>
    <h2>Fio Extrailis</h2>

    <p>See <span class="caps">Entrail-Extracting Curse.</span></p>
    <h2>Fidelius Charm</h2>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Unknown. </p>

    <p><strong>Effect: </strong>Conceals a piece of information (hereafter, a “secret”) in a single soul, called the
        “Secret Keeper.” The secret is imperceptible to anyone who has not been told the secret, which must be divulged
        voluntarily, not through Legilimency, Veritaserum, or any curse. </p>

    <p><strong>Variability: </strong>It's often wondered why James or Lily didn't keep their own secret, when Bill was
        Secret Keeper for Shell Cottage. Perhaps Bill simply wasn't protected and someone might have been able to find
        him if they looked hard enough, and Peter was likewise still vulnerable whenever he visited James and Lily, but
        it may also be that the betrayal of the Potters made evident a terrible flaw in the Fidelius Charm and that
        someone (or more) worked to improve the charm in the time between their deaths and Dumbledore's death. </p>

    <p><strong>Other information: </strong>When the Secret Keeper dies, everyone who was given the secret becomes a new
        Secret Keeper, but if no one else was told then the secret is lost forever. Presumably, the casting of the
        Fidelius Charm cannot remove the secret from minds which already hold it. Because the secret is concealed within
        the soul of the Secret Keeper, Horcruxes will probably interfere with the normal functioning of this spell (the
        obvious interaction would be that people with broken souls can't be Secret Keepers, but it could just as easily
        be the case that an individual Horcrux can be the Secret Keeper). In Deathly Hallows, we learn that the Fidelius
        Charm can be broken without the protected individuals knowing it, and that it is impossible to Disapparate away
        from the place protected by it. </p>

    <p>There has been a lot of fannish speculation about why the Potters weren't protected by any other method, why they
        didn't require Pettigrew to swear an Unbreakable Vow, etc., and the most interesting (to me) explanation is that
        the Fidelius Charm requires complete trust: other enchantments will interfere with the Fidelius Charm, even if
        their sole purpose is to trigger an alert in the event that the Fidelius Charm fails, and the Secret Keeper
        cannot be compelled to keep the secret any more than they can be compelled to give it up. In fact, if the people
        protected by the secret hold even an ounce of mistrust for the Secret Keeper, then the charm cannot hold. </p>

    <p><strong>Incantation:</strong> Ignis Deo. </p>

        extinguished by normal or enchanted water.</p>

        shapes of fiery beasts. Can destroy horcruxes.</p>

    </p>

    <p>Invented around the same time as the other Freezing Charm and requires as much skill to learn, much to the
        consternation of many, many students who found it more difficult to keep the two spells straight than to cast
        either one of them.</p>
