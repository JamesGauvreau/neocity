    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter has no summary.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>There are four basic approaches to working out the political situation in the Magical World. None of them work
        perfectly, but if you&rsquo;re reading and writing HP fanfic then you should be used to that by now.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each muggle country has a Ministry counterpart. Easy-peasy, you&rsquo;re done.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The ICW is more &ldquo;One World State&rdquo; than &ldquo;United Nations,&rdquo; and the various Ministries
            are relatively autonomous regional governments. For administrative simplicity, their jurisdictions could map
            to the muggle governments.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Roll everything back to the international situation when the Statute of Secrecy was signed in 1692, then
            decide how wixes adapted in the aftermath and advance from there. If the Statute of Secrecy merely
            formalized a withdrawal that had been going on for decades or even centuries, then you&rsquo;ll want to go
            back a bit further than 1692, of course.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Focus on &ldquo;peoples,&rdquo; groups joined by a sense of common identity (e.g. shared language and
            culture) and build your countries from there.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Countries and Regions Referenced in Canon</h1>
    
    <p>Canonically, we know that, besides Britain, there are ministries for a few other countries:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Africa: </b>Burkina Faso<sup>B+</sup></li>
        <li><b>Asia: </b>Bangladesh,<sup>B+</sup> China,<sup>G</sup> India,<sup>B+</sup> Iran,<sup>B+</sup>
            Japan,<sup>P</sup> Mongolia,<sup>B+</sup> Pakistan<sup>B+</sup></li>
        <li><b>Europe: </b>Andorra,<sup>B</sup> Bulgaria,<sup>B</sup> France,<sup>F</sup> Germany,<sup>B+</sup>
            Italy,<sup>G</sup> Liechtenstein,<sup>P</sup> Norway,<sup>B+</sup> Spain<sup>G</sup></li>
        <li><b>Oceania: </b>New Zealand<sup>B+</sup></li>
        <li><b>South America: </b>Brazil<sup>L</sup></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The superscript letters refer to the sources for each Ministry: B = the seven original books, B+ = the <em>
            Fantastic Beasts </em> and <em> Quidditch </em> books, F = films, G = video games, L = <em> Harry Potter
            Page to Screen: Limited Edition </em>, and P = Pottermore.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is also a Magical Congress of the United States,<sup>P</sup> and a Council of Magic in
        Argentina.<sup>P</sup> There is probably not a Ministry of Ireland, because Fudge represented the Irish at the
        Quidditch World Cup. This means that other national Quidditch teams do not necessarily represent independent
        states, e.g. the Transylvanian National Quidditch Team may be one of several Quidditch teams in Magical Romania
        or wherever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Abyssinia:</b> Mentioned in the name &ldquo;Abyssinian shrivelfig.&rdquo;</li>
        <li><b>Albania: </b>Mentioned many times as a hiding spot for Voldemort and also a travel destination for
            wizards.</li>
        <li><b>Andorra: </b>Mentioned by Barty Crouch Sr, while delirious.</li>
        <li><b>Armenia: </b>Lockhart mentions Armenian warlocks.</li>
        <li><b>Assyria: </b>Home to the Mimbulus Mimbletonia.</li>
        <li><b>Australia: </b>Mentioned by Percy.</li>
        <li><b>Brazil: </b>Home to Castelobruxo.</li>
        <li><b>Bulgaria: </b>Has a Quidditch team, and led by Minister Oblansk in 1994.</li>
        <li><b>China: </b>Home to the Chinese Fireball.</li>
        <li><b>Egypt: </b>Visited by the Weasleys. Gringotts curse-breakers work there.</li>
        <li><b>France: </b>Hagrid mentions going to France. First meeting-place of the ICW. Molly specifically mentions
            Fleur agreeing to have the wedding in Britain and not France.</li>
        <li><b>Greece: </b>Destination for Dumbledore and Doge's Grand Tour.</li>
        <li><b>Hungary: </b>Home to the Hungarian Horntail.</li>
        <li><b>Liechtenstein: </b>Protested the ICW when Pierre Bonaccord proposed to ban troll hunting and give rights
            to trolls.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><b>Luxembourg:</b>&nbsp;Their Quidditch team beat Scotland in 1994.</li>
        <li><b>Mongolia: </b>Snape says that kappa are found there.</li>
        <li><b>Peru: </b>Their Quidditch team was beaten by Ireland in 1994 QWC, and they export a variety of Instant
            Darkness Powder</li>
        <li><b>Poland: </b>Hagrid went across or past its border looking for giants.</li>
        <li><b>Romania: </b>Home to a dragon reserve.</li>
        <li><b>Sweden: </b>Lovegoods went there to look for Snorkacks.</li>
        <li><b>Tibet: </b>Kingsley gave false evidence to suggest that Sirius was in Tibet.</li>
        <li><b>Transylvania: </b>Their&nbsp;Quidditch team beat England in 1994 QWC. Also, Ron disguised himself as a
            Transylvanian&nbsp;during the Gringotts Heist.</li>
        <li><b>Turkey: </b>Beaten by England&rsquo;s national Quidditch team in the 1980s.</li>
        <li><b>Uganda:</b>&nbsp;Their Quidditch team beat Wales in the 1994 QWC.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Nationbuilding</h1>
    <p>But once you&rsquo;ve decided that there is such a country as Magical Russia, where do you go from there?
        Definitely, there should be something of the &ldquo;funhouse mirrors&rdquo; perspective that Magical Britain
        reflects upon its Muggle counterpart.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I also try to read about the fantasy genre as it stands in that country. In Russia, for example, there&rsquo;s a
        very obvious strain of &ldquo;two types of wizarding person, who are engaged in some sort of cold war&rdquo;
        trope running through stories like Tanya Grotter (Dmitri Yemets) and World of Watches (Sergei Lukyanenko). Not
        much has been made of this in <em> There is Nothing to Fear </em>&rsquo;s Russia, but it&rsquo;s the thematic
        backbone of Magical Russia in another story that I&rsquo;ve been working on.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Replacements for MACUSA</h2>
    <p>Not everyone likes Rowling&rsquo;s worldbuilding for Magical Murica. For alternatives, I chiefly recommend the
        Confederation from Inverarity&rsquo;s <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/1211079" rel="nofollow"> <em>
                Alexandra Quick </em> </a> series, and the Continental Union of Wizards from CogAndStar&rsquo;s <a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/2580133" rel="nofollow"> Unionverse </a> . There is also an <a
            href="https://americanwizarding.tumblr.com/" rel="nofollow"> American Wizarding </a> tumblr blog that might
        have some ideas that you like, and another called <a href="https://official-wizarding-america.tumblr.com/"
            rel="nofollow"> Wizarding America</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Kitzsah's &ldquo;<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/35830372/chapters/89345824" rel="nofollow">Map of the
            Modern Wizarding World</a>,&rdquo; mentioned above, also has a map of Indigenous American trade routes, and
        talks a lot about the history of North America, the Jewish Diaspora, and the Gilded Age in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The essay &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7698971/1/Populating-Wizarding-America" rel="nofollow">
            Populating Wizarding America </a>,&rdquo; by Dr. Platypus, is also worth a read. It gives a state-by-state
        breakdown of the wixen population in the USA, the wixen populations of the top twenty most populated (by wixes)
        cities, some figures for school-age children and non-humans, and a lengthy section on Quodpot. Dr. Platypus also
        raises some interesting points about population centers that are worth considering even for worldbuilding
        outside the United States:&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the local wixes are more conservative than not, or at least more reluctant to resettle, then they are
            likely to better represented in older cities than younger cities. Las Vegas, NV (founded 1901) probably has
            noticeably fewer wixes than Boston, MA (founded 1630), even though they have roughly the same population of
            muggles.&nbsp;Of course, European-American wixes are definitionally descended from wixes who were willingly
            to resettle abroad, so this cultural assumption may not be well-founded in their case, let alone anyone
            else&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Wixes who live muggle-side, or at least venture into muggle areas from time to time, probably prefer cities
            with greater cultural diversity and general eccentricity, so that it&rsquo;s easier for them to blend in and
            excuse any oddities.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Areas with a reputation for being &ldquo;haunted&rdquo; or otherwise weird are plausible candidates for a
            wixen hotspot.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Section III, &ldquo;Communities,&rdquo; is worth reading as well for its discussion about &ldquo;all-wizarding
        settlements&rdquo; like Hogsmeade, &ldquo;mixed wizard settlements&rdquo; like Ottery St. Catchpole, and
        &ldquo;isolated wizarding settlements&rdquo; like Little Hangleton. Regardless, keep in mind that the essay
        assumes 1 wix for every 10,000 muggles, rather than (as Taure assumes in <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V0Ivrl_5ehWAQVDTiHVG395AM7i9Pgul/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=117544339475577689457&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true"
            rel="nofollow">his Canon Plus document</a>) 3 wixes for every 10,000 muggles.&nbsp;</p>

                    stealing ideas with panache is to go one lever deeper and see where the other person got their ideas (which
                    is why I recommend, for example, that authors who are going to base their vampires on Anne Rice or something
                    should still read <em>Dracula</em>).&nbsp;</li>

                Britain did not colonize Magical India, and discusses (in ch. 5) what Magical Germany might look like and how it
                might have formed.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Using Maps</h2>
    <p>The blogger skluug created <a href="https://clout.substack.com/p/where-the-hell-is-everyone?sd=pf"
            rel="nofollow">a population density map</a>, which visualizes the world&rsquo;s population as one hundred
        dots, each representing 80 million people. My immediate thought upon seeing this was that it could be an
        interesting basis for defining magical countries.&nbsp;</p>

        but the most important thing is that this took about five minutes, rather than the five weeks that it might take
        to start from IRL 17th century borders and invent four centuries of shadow historical politicking.&nbsp;</p>

    <h2>National Vignettes</h2>
    <p>Short profiles of magical countries for you to use as fodder, whether you just want a brief sketch for making
        offhand references and (more wisely than me) have resisted the urge to spend a day's research for a single
        sentence, or you want a foundation on which to build in greater detail, or whatever.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Greece (Hellas) || </b>It is said in this country that there are no Muggle-borns, only Half-bloods of unknown
        provenance, for the blood of heroes springs only from heroes. Even some Pure-blood children end up raised by
        Muggles, for it is rare but not unheard-of for Grecian wixes to place their offspring with Muggles (especially
        if they are unwanted), and an accomplished Muggle-born like Hermione Granger would have no trouble finding an
        established family that was willing to claim her as one of their own. Greek society is dominated by heroic
        mystery cults, which serve as both educational and political institutions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Italy, Italic States (Civitadi Italica) || </b>The Italian Peninsula has not been fully unified, even as a
        confederation, since the days of the Roman Empire. It is generally said to be comprised of the Three Proscribed
        Cities (Controma, Villa Ferrata, and Occultus Mons), each of which has unique strictures on who may live or even
        enter therein, and the Three Prescribed Colleges. Latin is still spoken in parts of Italy, though it has changed
        since Roman and even Medieval times, just as English has changed over the centuries, and so may occasionally be
        called Modern or Vernacular Latin.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Peru || </b>Following the Statute of Secrecy, American wixes continued to use the administrative structure of
        the two Viceroyalties of the Spanish Empire. Since that time, &ldquo;New Spain&rdquo; collapsed, but the
        Viceroyalty of Peru remained intact and even incorporated some territories that once belonged to New Spain. It
        maintains a series of &ldquo;magical councils&rdquo; that oversee operations relating to specific Muggle
        countries, and operates like a miniature I.C.W., albeit with somewhat more centralization.</p>
