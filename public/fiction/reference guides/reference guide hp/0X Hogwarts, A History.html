    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter has no summary.</p>
    <hr>
    Wellingtongoose wrote a four-article series about Hogwarts, part-speculative revisionist history and part-geography:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://wellingtongoose.livejournal.com/32344.html">Hogwarts: A Founding</a> covers the founding
            and pre-castle history of Hogwarts. Herein, proto-Hogsmeade arose
            as a fortified settlement as people alike fled from Scottish wars, English anarchy, and Viking incursions,
            and the “school” was originally a kind of cooperative apprenticeship between the four wixes that we would
            later call the Founders. Wellingtongoose also suggests that the Sorting Hat was only created <i>after</i>
            Slytherin
            left. </li>
        <li><a href="https://wellingtongoose.livejournal.com/32705.html">Hogwarts: An Evolution</a> goes into
            Slytherin's departure, his replacement by apprentices who had trained under
            him (and their inevitable, even unintentional distortion of his philosophy), the enchantment of the Sorting
            Hat, and finally the development of Hogwarts into something we would recognize as a <i>school</i>, which
            might've
            taken until the 15th or 16th centuries. </li>
        <li><a href="https://wellingtongoose.livejournal.com/32867.html">Hogwarts: The Castle</a> discusses the
            construction of the castle and the subsequent development of Hogsmeade.
            Wellingtongoose suggests that the Wizengamot originally met at Hogwarts, and the Ministry of Magic was based
            there until relocating to London in the 18th or 19th centuries. </li>
        <lI><a href="https://wellingtongoose.livejournal.com/33208.html">Hogwarts: The Chamber of Secrets</a> talks
            about how and why Slytherin made a fucking basilisk pit in the bowels
            of a school. </lI>
    </ul>
    <p>In “The Black Arms: Preliminary Observations” and “The Black Arms: Further Speculation,” wemyss talks about
        heraldry
        and tries to draw come conclusions about the Black family's history, based on what we know about their coat of
        arms.</p>
    <p> Swythyv proposed that Salazar Slytherin's locket was actually a set of counter-Basilisk spectacles:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"Lockets" were invented during Victorian times. They enclosed a memento (usually hair) of a dead loved one,
            and
            didn't always have glass inside even after photography became more common. There was no such thing as a
            "locket"
            when Hogwarts was founded, and no millennium-old reliquary would open to reveal two glass windows.</p>
        <p>"Slytherin's Locket" was a set of magical goggles. Basilisk goggles.</p>
        <p>The attached chain would constrict itself snugly around the user's head, holding the opened goggles securely
            in place with its magical glass "windows" over the user's eyes and its metal casing toward the basilisk.
            This
            device allowed Salazar Slytherin to go safely where anyone with him would have to go blindfolded. Or die. So
            I
            doubt anyone
            but Sal ever saw it open, and anyone who did was not likely to talk about it afterward. Or describe the
            "monster."</p>

    <h2>People</h2>
    <p>We don’t know all that much about the Founders, but the Sorting Hat’s song in 1994 gives a clue to their origins:
        Godric, Helga, Rowena, and Salazar came from “wild moor,” “glen,” “valley broad,” and “fen,” which are generally
        interpreted as the West Country, Scotland, Wales, and East Anglia, respectively. </p>
    <p>The Burkes are presumably related to William de Burgh, whose surname was later gaelicized to de Búrca, then
        became Búrca, then Burke. </p>
    <p>The Gaunts may hail from the Flemish city of Ghent, which is also known as “Gaunt” in English, and is responsible
        for the epithet of at least one Englishman, John of Gaunt, and perhaps also Maurice de Gaunt and Robert de
        Gaunt, but we know little about Maurice and less still about his maternal grandfather, Robert. </p>
    <p>We all know the joke about poor Remus Lupin being named “Wolf Wolf,” but did you know that his father, Lyall
        Lupin, is also a Wolf Wolf? Probably, the name that Remus was given was less “an obvious sign that this kid is
        going to be a werewolf someday” and more “a long-running family joke, now gone horribly wrong.” The name “Lyall”
        suggests a Scottish influence and a willingness to adapt surnames, so the Lupin family tree may also include
        wizards by the name of Lowell or Lovell, Shaw, and Ulric, and witches by the name of Lovelle and Ulrica. If any
        of his ancestors had a taste for French names, then they might have considered Loup or Louve (and the name “Loup
        Lupin” is undoubtedly appealing for a certain kind of person). Lupercus or Luperca, referring to the wolf who
        nursed Remus and Romulus, are also good choices. </p>
    <h3>Gryffindor, Godric</h3>
    <p> <b>LadyAramisGrey:</b> Godric is from God and ric, “power,” i.e. “power of God,” which suggests devout Christian
        parents. LadyAramisGrey believes this further suggests that his parents were muggles, but the Christianity vs
        Magic thing is very overblown. Gryffindor can be understood as Gryffin d’Or, i.e. “Griffin of Gold” or “Gold
        Griffin,” suggesting that his father came from French nobility, or that Godric spent time with French speakers
        on the east coast or actually traveled to France for a time, and received his epithet there. </p>
    <p><b>Wemyss:</b> “Godric” is Saxon and Gryffindor is “bastardized French-Norman.” He was probably born in Devon, Cornwall,
        or the West Country. </p>

    <h3>Hufflepuff, Hegla</h3>
    <p><b>LadyAramisGrey:</b> Norse, of course. Helga is derived from Helge or Helgi, and further from <i>heilagr</i>, “blessed, holy.” What’s curious is that Helga came from the “valley broad,” indicating Wales, while Scandinavian influence was strongest in Scotland and Northumbria, but it’s not out of the question that one or both of her parents migrated south or even that they simply had some familiarity with the name and liked it, which would have been out of place but not <i>unknowable</i>. Hufflepuff can possibly be derived (in part) from <i>pyf</i>, “a blast of wind, puff” or <i>ápyffan</i>, “to exhale, breathe out,” perhaps indicating a windy location within the borders of modern Wales but, at the time, inhabited by English-speakers. </p>
    <p><b>Loopily:</b> Helga is Norse, meaning “faithful.” </p>
    <p><b>Wemyss:</b> Hufflepuff comes from <i>Hvalpuf</i>, or “whalespout.” Owing to the Germanic origin of her name, she probably came from Swansea or the Vale of Glamorgan, or perhaps from Cumbria, which lies further north but matches the “valley broad” description.</p>

    <h3>Ravenclaw, Rowena</h3>
    <p><b>LadyAramisGrey:</b> The tidiest etymology would be Germanic, Rowena coming from <i>hrod</i>, “fame” and <i>wunn</i>, “bliss, joy,” and Ravenclaw from <i>Hrabanklawe</i>, literally meaning “raven claw.” This would be a fine Saxon name, but she is said to have come from Scotland, which would make her more likely to be Norse than Saxon. A parallel construction is Hræfnclawu. In any case, she was probably from Lothian, possibly from Northumbria. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Loopily:</b> Rowena is Gaelic, meaning “red-haired and rugged.” </p>
    <p><b>Wemyss:</b> Rowena is Jutish or Saxon, suggesting an origin in Kent, but “glen” suggests Scotland. Ravenclaw might be a literal translation from Gaelic or Welsh. However, the wizard Hengist of Woodcroft is clearly a Saxon, so it isn’t out of the question that Rowena or her family also immigrated to Scotland. It is also possible that Rowena is a Saxon woman of noble birth, who was wed to a Scotsman. </p>
    <p>Someone suggested to me a long time ago that Rowena’s last name could also refer to a botched attempt at self-transfiguration or animagery, which left her with a bird’s foot for a hand. Rowena had been attempting to become an eagle, but the dark feathers gave other people the impression of a raven. She was unable to reverse the transfiguration for several years, so in paintings from this period Rowena is shown from a slightly slanted perspective in order to conceal her embarrassing bird-foot hand. 
    </p>

    <h3>Slytherin, Salazar</h3>
    <p><b>LadyAramisGrey:</b> Salazar is a Spanish and Portuguese surname, from <i>sala</i>, “hall,” and the Basque <i>zahar</i>, “old,” meaning roughly, “dweller in the old hall.” He was probably from the Fenlands of Anglia, which were long regarded as a refuge for runaways, and was perhaps the son of a Spanish exile. Slytherin may come from <i>slidrian</i>, “to slip,” perhaps indicating a slippery waterbank; or <i>sliferne</i>, “slippery” but also “deceitful.” Godric just called him a slippery bastard and the name stuck (maybe because he was originally Salazar Slidrian and the epithet was kind of punny). 
    </p>
    <p><b>Loopily:</b> Salazar is Spanish, meaning “manor.” He might have some from East Anglia or Spain, but “we could easily imagine Salazar as a Byzantine merchant, coming to Britain to trade [...] and funding the entire Hogwarts scheme.” </p>
    <p><b>Wemyss:</b> Slytherin is probably derived from <i>sliþrian</i>, which appears to be an original construction. </p>

    <h2>Places</h2>
    <h3>Hogsmeade</h3>
    <p><b>LadyAramisGrey:</b> “Valley by the Hill” or “Hill’s Valley,” from <i>hoge</i>, “hill,” and <i>mæd</i>, “meadow, pasture, valley.” </p>
    <p><b></b></p>

    <h3>Hogwarts</h3>
    <p><b>LadyAramisGrey:</b> “Hill of Wards” or “Warded Hill,” from <i>hoge</i>, “hill,” and <i>weards</i>, “guarding, protections,” eventually shifting from Hogeweards to Hogwarts.</p>
    <p><b></b></p>
