    <h1>How can Barty Crouch, Sr. speak more than 200 languages? <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <blockquote>

        <p>Bagman turned most cheerfully back to Mr. Weasley.</p>

        <p>“Couldn't do me a brew, I suppose? I'm keeping an eye out for Barty Crouch. My Bulgarian opposite number's
            making difficulties, and I can't understand a word he's saying. Barty'll be able to sort it out. He speaks
            about a hundred and fifty languages.”</p>

        <p>“Mr. Crouch?” said Percy, suddenly abandoning his look of poker-stiff disapproval and positively writhing
            with excitement. “He speaks over two hundred! Mermish and Gobbledegook and Troll ...”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>How does this work? <b>The quick explanation would be that people are mistaken</b>, but this doesn't work so
        well. If it were just Percy Weasley, I would suggest that he's exaggerating because he's so enamored with
        Crouch, and perhaps that's why he corrects Bagman with a bigger number, but it's hard to see why Bagman would
        give an inflated number. Whether or not he's correct, he probably believes that he's correct, which suggests
        that knowing one hundred and fifty languages is at least plausible.</p>

    <p>An alternative to the quick explanation is that Percy and Bagman say such things because Crouch himself lied
        about his abilities. We must still ask ourselves why anybody would consider this plausible, but the diplomat
        John Bowring said that he knew two hundred languages, and though some people have called bullshit on that claim,
        others believed him.</p>

    <p><b>Some fanfics suggest magic: </b>There are charms, translating earrings, or “language lozenges” or something
        else that make learning another language easy. This opens up other questions, like “Why isn't this magical
        solution used more widely?” Offloading everything onto a spell also means that nobody should think highly of
        Crouch for knowing one or two hundred languages.</p>

    <p>But perhaps magic hastens, rather than grants, the acquisition of another language, so that Crouch's linguistic
        prowess is akin to learning half a dozen languages the Muggle way: difficult and worthy of mention but in no way
        impossible. We might wonder why language lozenges aren't used by Hogwarts students, but (1) they might not be
        effective or safe for a developing mind and (2) Harry never tries to learn another language or discuss with
        Hermione what her Study of Ancient Runes class was like, so for all we know, Hogwarts students <em> do </em>use
        magic to speed up the acquisition of another language.</p>

    <p>Other possibilities are that language-learning magic involves…</p>
    <ul>
        <li>…“bloodline talents” or “family magic,” i.e. the Crouch family talent has something to do with polyglottism

                rel="nofollow">h/t u/amethyst_lover</a>).</li>
        <li>…a complex potion whose ingredients include the saliva of a person who speaks the language which you want to

                rel="nofollow">h/t u/rfresa</a>).Perhaps the saliva must come from a native speaker, so dead languages
            must be learned the natural way (<a

                rel="nofollow">h/t u/A_Balrog_Is_Come</a>)</li>
        <li>…Occlumency or another branch of mental magic, which doesn't necessarily grant proficiency in languages but
            makes that path possible, perhaps through improving memory or allowing another trick (h/t <a
                href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/13o9qwf/on_crouch_the_polyglot_some_thoughts_on_how_to/jl3au15/"

    </ul>

    <p><b>The third solution has to do with the lines that we draw (and don't draw) between languages. </b>Rioplatense
        is a dialect of Spanish, Portuguese is universally considered a language in its own right, and Aragonese used to
        be classified as a Spanish dialect but in recent times is more often considered a language that is closely
        related to, but distinct from, Spanish.</p>

    <p>We can talk about the precise differences between Aragonese, Rioplatense, Spanish, and Portuguese, and how
        similar one is or isn't to another, but the biggest factor may well be Max Weinrich's dictum that “a language is
        a dialect with an army and navy.” We might also add, “or a dialect that <em> wants </em>an army and navy” —
        nationalism often plays a big part in determining whether something gets classified as a language or not, even
        if the proponents of X-as-language haven't yet established an independent government.</p>

    <p>When Percy says that Barty Crouch speaks two hundred languages, he mentions languages like “Mermish” and “Troll,”
        but there are probably dozens of languages that we might call “Mermish,” just like saying that somebody speaks
        “Chinese” only <em> probably </em> tells you what language they really speak. Also, Percy is referring to
        languages which he probably considers to be exotic (note that these are all nonhuman languages), but it could be
        the case that the majority of Crouch's languages are rather humdrum.</p>

    <p><b>How fluent is Crouch, anyway? </b>If I can say hello, ask for directions, and briefly comment on the weather
        in French and Vietnamese, then you might say that I speak these languages, albeit in a limited fashion. If
        Crouch is fluent in a dozen languages and can hold a five minute conversation (but no more) in another two
        hundred languages, well, that's certainly impressive and Crouch has every right to brag about it if he's so
        inclined but it doesn't beggar belief. People who can hold extended conversations in fifty languages are rare
        but they do exist.</p>
    <h1><a name="DingDong" rel="nofollow" id="DingDong"></a>Who Attempted to Defenestrate Minister Fudge?<a
            href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>

    <p>In the first chapter of HBP, “The Other Minister,” we learn that the current Prime Minister — presently serving
        in 1996 — was preceded by a man:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>“I must say, you're taking it a lot better than your predecessor. He tried to throw me out of the window,
            thought I was a hoax planned by the opposition.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It is typically assumed that Fudge is speaking with John Major, the U.K.'s Prime Minister from 1990 to 1997, but
        Major's predecessor was Margaret Thatcher, which presents us with two problems:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Margaret Thatcher would not have been referred to as “he.”</li>
        <li>Fudge's term as Minister for Magic began in 1990, but Margaret Thatcher's term as Prime Minister began in
            1980. While their terms probably overlapped (Thatcher did not resign until the 28th of November), Thatcher
            would have already met Millicent Bagnold (who served from 1980-1990) and therefore had no reason to think
            that Fudge's visit was a hoax.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If we take these facts as valid then we have to conclude that Muggle history is not <em> our </em> history. It
        diverged no later than 1990, and perhaps earlier than that. I've outlined a few possibilities below:</p>

    <p><b>The Prime Minister in HBP is not John Major. </b>When John Major became Prime Minister in 1990, it was
        expected that he was going to lead the Conservatives in defeat and that Neil Kinnock of the Labour Party would
        succeed him. The would-be defenestrator would then be John Major.</p>

    <p><b>Michael Heseltine won leadership of the Conservative Party — for a time. </b>When Heseltine went head to head
        against Thatcher in 1990, he won 40% of the vote (out of a pool of 372 votes). It's conceivable that he might
        have won, and just as conceivable that his success might have been short-lived, losing either to Labour in 1990
        or to a subsequent leadership challenge (perhaps from John Major, and perhaps not).</p>

    <p><b>Margaret Thatcher never saw the year 1990. </b> Up until Halloween, 1981 was a bad, <em> bad </em> year for
        Magical Britain, and Voldemort never seemed closer to victory. In order to delegitimize the magical government
        by proving their inability to manage and protect their Muggle counterparts, Voldemort murdered Margaret
        Thatcher. This is why the Prime Minister was assigned a wizarding bodyguard in 1996 and not before —
        assassinating a major Muggle politician was so beyond the pale that, even after Voldemort did it, nobody
        seriously thought that someone else would follow his example. Perhaps he was considered an outlier just because
        nobody else would risk the consequences: “Sure, you could kill the PM but we'll definitely find you and then
        send you to Azkaban forever” works great until you're dealing with “the most feared Dark wizard for a hundred
        years.”</p>

    <p>It's unclear what would happen if Margaret Thatcher died in office; parliamentary politics are often less
        straightforward than in the U.S., where you could kill a dozen people in the line of succession and still know
        who was next. But we can speculate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Edward Heath was the leader of the Conservative Party when he was challenged in 1975, and he fared fairly
            well: 119 votes to Thatcher's 130. I don't know of anyone in the Conservative Party who lost leadership of
            the party and later regained it, but in the Labour Party, Ramsay MacDonald did it twice, and Arthur
            Henderson thrice.</li>
        <li>Michael Heseltine might have taken a shot at leadership ten years earlier, but he didn't run in the 1975
            leadership election and I don't know enough to say whether he would have been more interested six years
            later.</li>
        <li>William Whitelaw was Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party from 1975 to 1991, and previously made a bid
            for leadership in 1975. Whitelaw was not appointed to the House of Lords until 1983, so there would be no
            conflict there.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Besides Voldemort, Thatcher might've also died in 1984, when the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton. Five
        people died in our history, and if Thatcher had needed to visit her hotel bathroom just shy of 3 a.m., there
        would have been six.</p>
