                Resources &amp; Changelog</a>. </strong>You can expect some items to move out of here as the Guide
        expands</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Changelog: </b>It's a changelog.</li>
        <li><b>Potter Canon: </b>How this guide uses the term "canon," resources for finding canonical information, and
            a few deep dive analyses of canon that others have written.</li>
        <li><b>Potter Fanon: </b>General worldbuilding and other resources which set themselves in the HP universe but
            aren't canonical. This includes maps, theorizing on the locations of different things, etc. </li>
        <li><b>IRL: </b>Useful stuff that isn't tied to the Harry Potter universe, like old maps, an 1828 dictionary,
            and several databases of edible plants, mushrooms, and etc. in Scotland.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>On Chapter Length: </b>In short, “Don't be too long.” </li>
        <li><b>On Foreshadowing: </b>Especially important in Harry Potter ficdom, where fanon and disagreements of
            interpretation of canon are common, and your reader may therefore have a very different understanding than
            you of what is possible.</li>
        <li><b>On Writing Descriptions: </b>My personal techniques for writing visual descriptions (which may be helpful
            for aphantasic writers in particular), considering point-of-view when you decide what and how to describe,
            and avoiding overly-generic words like “it” when you can be specific.</li>
