            href="http://members.madasafish.com/~cj_whitehound/Fanfic/Britpicks.htm" rel="nofollow"> Britpicker's
            Guide</a>, with sections on food, wildlife, sports, clothes, profanity, et cet. There are subsections like
        “Things Britons don't eat at breakfast (but Americans apparently do).” Her site also has a list of <a
            href="http://members.madasafish.com/~cj_whitehound/Fanfic/Britrefs.htm" rel="nofollow"> British cultural
            references in the books</a>, which I think that every American writer of HP fic should check out. On Reddit,
        you might also get some use from <a

    <h2>Useful Tools</h2>
    <p>If you want to maintain British spelling, then you can change the native language of your word processor by
        following the instructions below. If you use a program that isn't listed here, then let me know and I'll add it
        to the list.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google Docs: (1) Go to <a href="http://docs.google.com" rel="nofollow">docs.google.com</a>. (2) Click the
            three horizontal bars ≡ in the upper-right corner of the screen. (3) Click “Settings.” (4) Under “Language,”
            click your current language. (5) On the new screen or tab that's displayed, click the pen symbol 🖊 and then
            search for, and click, “English.” (6) Search for, and click, “United Kingdom.”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I haven't yet found any free online tools for Britpicking your spelling, except for websites like <a
            href="https://www.reverso.net/spell-checker/english-spelling-grammar/" rel="nofollow"> Reverso</a>, which
        will correct American spellings if you ask it to do so but limits you to 450 characters at a time. I really
        recommend using a word processor (if your word processor of choice isn't in the list, then let me know and I'll
        add instructions).</p>

    <h1>Common Cultural Mistakes Made by Americans</h1>
    <p>It's worth noting that nouns which refer to multiple people are treated as plurals: you wouldn't say “my family
        is” or “the government is,” like an American, but rather “my family are” or “the government are.” </p>
    <p>American writers should save a link to the Wikipedia article, “<a

    <p>The British are not so religious as Americans, and Evangelicals and Fundamentalists are much rarer. You are
        especially unlikely to see anything to do with exorcisms, especially when Tom Riddle lived at Wool's Orphanage
        (neither the Church of England nor the Catholic Church were keen on exorcisms at that time), and <em> modern
        </em> exorcisms are generally more sedate than Hollywood films might've led you to believe. They also include
        visits by a psychiatrist to make sure that the supposed victim of possession isn't just in need of medical
        care. </p>

    <p>Speaking of Wool's Orphanage: Institutions like Wool's were phased out in the 1950s and no longer exist. Sad as
        it is, Harry Potter cannot grow up in an orphanage. </p>

    <p>As for other miseries that we are unfortunately unable to heap upon poor Harry Potter, it makes no sense for the
        Dursleys to deny medical care to Harry on account of the doctor costing too much. Despite the best efforts of
        the Conservative Party, the National Health Service yet lives, and it was doing fine enough in the 1980s and
        1990s, too. Check out <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/UsefulNotes/NationalHealthService"
            rel="nofollow"> Useful Notes / NHS</a> for a basic rundown on how healthcare works when you don't live in
        America. Glasses in particular are subsidized for children (and some others), so the Dursleys should only
        complain about the cost of glasses if they're lying.</p>

    <h1>The British Peerage</h1>
    <blockquote>

        <p>“I'm still undecided about Tom Riddle. Trevor Doom, now…that's different.” </p>

        <p>“Change what?”</p>

        <p>“The name. Trevor Doom, LL.D. It's missing letters. Tom Marvolo Riddle?” </p>

        <p>“Okay, Trevor <em> Iam </em> Doom, LL.D.”</p>

        <p>“Iam?! That's not a name!”</p>

        <p>“Of course it is. Short for Iambus. Perfectly valid name, Iam. Come to think of it maybe he used it. Iam <em>
                comma </em> Lord Voldemort — that's a name. Lord Voldemort on its own is just a title — and title as in
            land at that. There'd have to be some place for him to be lord of, a marshy little cul-de-sac called
            Voldemort somewhere. Place with a lot of swamp gas, <em> ignis fatuus</em>. Probably in Jersey.” </p>

    <p><em> Important disclaimer: Behind the British peerage there stands a thousand years of bullshit, and exceptions
            to nearly every rule. Consider </em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_of_Selkirk" rel="nofollow">
            <em> the Earl of Selkirk</em></a><em>, a title governed by rules of inheritance that are even more bullshit
            than usual.  </em></p>

    <p>There are five titles of British peerage: duke, marquess, earl, viscount, and baron. Older titles, or titles
        which were created earlier in history, are “more senior” than other titles, which mostly matters when you need a
        tiebreaker in your aristocratic dick-measuring contest. The most senior title is the “premier” of that title,
        e.g. premier duke, premier baron. </p>

    <p>The titles of “hereditary peers” are inheritable, and the titles of “life peers” (or “working peers”) are not.
        Since 1958, life peers have been created on recommendation by the Main Honours Committee, itself composed of
        eight sub-committees: Arts and Media, Community, Economy, Education, Health, Science and Technology, Sport, and
        the State. The results are typically in batches on regular special occasions, such as the monarch's birthday.
        Since 2000, there have also been “people's peers,” recommended by the House of Lords Appointments Commission;
        their titles are uninheritable as well. Until 1999, a register of hereditary peerages was kept on the Roll of
        the Lords Spiritual and Temporal. </p>

    <p>As originally practiced, proxy voting was conducted by sending someone of lesser rank in one's place. By the
        early 1600s, proxies were typically selected from among other members of Parliament, though in 1626 members were
        banned from casting votes for more than two proxies at a time. Proxy voting has been banned in the House of
        Lords since 1868. </p>

    <p>When a title is formed, it is said that a peer has been <b>created</b>. The children of the peer, or
        title-holder, are the peer's <b>issue</b>. Where it is believed that there is an heir <em> somewhere </em> but
        they cannot be found or their status cannot be proven, then the title falls <b>dormant</b>. When it is believed
        that there is no heir, the title becomes <b>extinct</b>. Obviously, it is possible for a title to be considered
        dormant but really be extinct. Titles that have been renounced or relinquished are said to have been
        <b>disclaimed</b>. The terms under which a title may be inherited are collectively referred to as that title's
        <b>remainder</b>. 
    </p>

    <p>Laws of inheritance are specific to a title, and generally refer to three kinds of heir: (1) <b>heirs male of the
            body</b>, who descend directly from the previous holder of the title; (2) <b>heirs male whatsoever</b>, who
        need not claim a direct line of descent; (3) <b>heirs whatsoever</b>. Inheritance may be limited to legitimate
        or “legally begotten” heirs, but “legitimacy” can often be obtained very late, even through performing a
        marriage while the mother is in labor. With regard to these requirements, one may speak of heirs-male,
        heirs-general, etc. Adopted children cannot inherit titles in the Muggle world, but things may be different for
        witches and wizards. </p>

    <p>The eldest eligible child of the peer is the <b>heir apparent</b> ; if the peer has no children, then the next
        claimant in line is called the <b>heir presumptive</b>. If the peer dies without eligible children then the heir
        presumptive inherits, unless the peer's widow says that she is (or may be) pregnant, in which case inheritance
        is held off until the matter can be resolved. </p>

    <p>There were once also “<b>baronies by tenure</b>,” which were held simply by possession of land and a castle, but
        these became increasingly uncommon over the generations until they were entirely abolished in 1861. </p>

    <p>If a title may be held only by male heirs but the previous peer, upon his death, had only daughters, and at least
        two of these daughters have eligible sons, then the title may “fall into abeyance,” which is to say that it is
        not held by anybody. The title remains in abeyance between the “co-heirs” until such a time that they come to an
        agreement regarding the inheritance of that title, which must not have been in abeyance for more than one
        hundred years; or, until such a time that only one possible heir remains. In the former case, the co-heirs must
        then petition the Crown so that the title may be “called out of abeyance.” </p>

    <p><b>Dukedoms </b>were originally created by the fastening of a ceremonial sword to a belt or girdle, but since
        1615 this practice was replaced by the conferral of letters patent under the Great Seal. In speech, dukes and
        duchesses are addressed as “Your Grace.” </p>
    <details>
        <summary>Example</summary>
        <blockquote>

            <p>Let's say that Rodolphus is the Duke of Wereham, the Earl of Ingoldisthorpe, and the Viscount of Stoke
                Ferry, that he and Bellatrix have three children — Soteira, Lesath, and Sagitta — and that the
                inheritance laws in Norfolk pay no regard to sex or gender. Rodolphus himself would be Rodolphus
                Lestrange, 10th Duke of Wereham, and he might be called “Duke Wereham” or, among that special liminal
                zone of acquaintances close enough for familiarity but not close enough for first names, just “Wereham.”
                Bellatrix would probably sign papers as “Bellatrix Wereham,” using her husband's title rather than his
                surname. Together, they would be the Duke and Duchess of Wereham. </p>

            <p>Soteira, using her father's second-best title, would be Lady Soteira Ingoldisthorpe (and heir-apparent),
                and her brother would be Lord Lesath Lestrange. If the laws permitted only male heirs, then her brother
                would be Lord Ingoldisthorpe. Either way, the youngest Lestrange child would be Lady Sagitta Lestrange,
                even if she married outside of the aristocracy. If, however, Sagitta married Patrick Cornfoot, 11th Earl
                of Kilmany, then she would adopt his title and become Lady Kilmany, or Countess of Kilmany. </p>

            <p>Later, Soteira marries Cadogan Mockridge, a fourth-born child with little chance of inheriting a title,
                and they have a child, August. Because August is, so to speak, Rodolphus Lestrange's grand-heir (he is
                due to become the Duke of Wereham someday, presuming that Soteira lives long enough to become Duchess
                ahead of him), he will be able to use his grandfather's third-best title as Lord August. </p>

            <p>Generally speaking, unmarried children are referred to by both their Christian name and surname (i.e.
                Lord Lesath Lestrange, Lady Sagitta Lestrange), but the spouse of a peer uses only their last name (i.e.
                if Lesath married Joan Sharp, 4th Baroness of Wemyss, and was not due to inherit any titles from his
                parents, then he would adopt her title and become “the Lord Wemyss”).</p>

            <p>Husbands typically do not get titles from their spouses (Queen Elizabeth's husband was Prince Philip, not
                King Philip), so if Soteira instead married Harry Potter, the son of a wealthy but untitled burgher,
                then he would remain Mr. Potter (in a more egalitarian society, this might not be the case), though
                their firstborn child, Hedwigus, would be the Viscount of Stoke Ferry just like her alternate-universe
                half-brother August. If both spouses have a title, then they will both use the superior title (assuming
                that the spouse with the inferior title is able to use their spouse's title).</p>

    <p><b>Marquessates</b> are created by letters patent under the Great Seal. The rank is not especially popular; there
        are nearly as many extant dukedoms as there are marquessates. In speech, marquesses and marchionesses are
        addressed as “My Lord.” </p>
    <details>
        <summary>Example</summary>
        <blockquote>

            <p>Suzanne Bones (not to be confused with Susan Bones) is the 5th Marchioness of Clavering. She may also be
                called Lady Clavering, or simply “Clavering,” and her husband, Art Bones, is the Marquess of Clavering,
                or Lord Clavering. As the peer's spouse, he would sign papers as “Art Clavering.”</p>
        </blockquote>
    </details>

    <p><b>Earldoms </b>are typically life peerages or hereditary and inheritable only by direct male heirs, but some
        Scottish earldoms can be inherited by women or through the female line. Like dukes, they were originally created
        by ceremonial sword shindiggery but since 1615 have been created by letters patent. In speech, earls and
        countesses (there is no other feminine form) are addressed as “Lord [Whatever]” and “Lady [Whatever].” </p>
    <details>
        <summary>Example</summary>
        <blockquote>

            <p>Peadar Dukelow, 13th Earl of Riverstick, will be the Earl of Riverstick, or Lord Riverstick, or simply
                Riverstick, as described above. His husband, Francis Merrythought, conveniently has no title, so we can
                easily say that he would sign papers as “Francis Riverstick.” Their son, Hawkin, does not have an
                ordinary courtesy title. </p>
        </blockquote>
    </details>

    <p><b>Viscountcies </b>were first created in 1440 but were unpopular until the 1600s, so it's plausible that there
        are few to zero wixen viscounts. They are created by letters patent. In speech, viscounts and viscountesses are
        addressed as “Lord [Whatever]” and “Lady [Whatever].”</p>

    <p><b>Baronies </b>were originally created as life peers via a summons by Royal Writ to attend the King's Counsel or
        Parliament. There was no assumption of inheritance, but in practice a baron's heir would usually receive their
        own summons, and on and on, until the practice solidified and baronies were hereditary by default. Since the
        1400s, baronies have typically been created by letters patent. In speech, barons and baronesses are addressed as
        “Lord [Whatever]” and “Lady [Whatever],” and never described as “Baron [Whomever].” </p>

    <p>Courtesy titles in summary: If a duke, marquess, or earl has multiple titles, then their heir apparent may use
        one their lesser titles. Younger sons of a duke or marquess have the courtesy title of “Lord [first name] [last
        name],” and younger sons of an earl, as well as all children of a viscount or baron, have the courtesy title of
        “The Honorable [first name] [last name].” Daughters of a duke, marquess, or earl have the courtesy title of
        “Lady [first name] [last name].” Whatever the details, courtesy titles are usually taken up at the age of
        majority (i.e. Soteira Lestrange does not become Soteira Ingoldisthorpe until she is seventeen) and do not grant
        a seat in the House of Lords. </p>

    <p>Below the barons are the baronets and knights, who are not peers, and whose chief distinction from each other is
        that baronetcies are inheritable and knighthoods are not. Baronets and knights are addressed as “Sir [first
        name] [last name],” e.g. “Sir Arcturus Black,” and their wives as “Lady [last name],” e.g. Lady Black. Female
        baronets and knights are addressed as “Dame [first name] [last name],” e.g. “Dame Poppy Pomfrey.” </p>

    <p>As <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/jwnf6g/britpicking_lordships_and_titles/"
            rel="nofollow"> Ermithecow points out</a>, titles may (rarely) be connected to names, e.g. Lucius Malfoy,
        17th Earl Malfoy. “It would make sense that wizarding peers aren't linked to land because the muggles would know
        who they were in that case,” though it would also make sense for Muggle and magical jurisdictions to overlap.
        Another word from Ermithecow: “it is absolutely not the done thing that teachers or other authority figures
        refer to children by their titles.” Soteira could ask the teachers to call her “Ingoldisthorpe” rather than
        “Lestrange” (once she's old enough) but not “Lady Ingoldisthorpe” or anything similar. </p>
