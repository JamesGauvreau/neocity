    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>This chapter has no summary.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Because this chapter's title refers to &ldquo;mistakes,&rdquo; I want to stress that this chapter isn&rsquo;t
        about ruining your fun. There is a <em> great </em> difference between &ldquo;writing something that is at odds
        with canon (or history, or British culture) because you don&rsquo;t know any better&rdquo; and &ldquo;writing
        something that is at odds with those things because you deliberately chose to write your story that way.&rdquo;
        <b>It is one thing to break the rules of writing by accident and another thing to break them on purpose</b>, and
        adherence to canon is different in only one respect: you don&rsquo;t necessarily have to refer to a rule of
        writing before you break it, but it is generally wise to refer to a departure from canon (or even widely-held
        fanon) before that departure becomes important to the plot.</p>
    <h1>Canon&nbsp;</h1>
    <p>This shouldn&rsquo;t need saying, but <b>Pure-bloods are not specialer or better at magic than Muggle-borns or
            Half-bloods</b>. Pure-blood supremacism is a dirty ideology with no more justification than any type of
        racial supremacism.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Don&rsquo;t mistake aesthetics for values. <b>British wixes are not a bunch of temporally-displaced Victorians.
        </b> A woman became Minister for Magic in 1798, and there&rsquo;s no indication of racism (far from it, in fact,
        since Cantankerus Nott seemed to have no problem listing the Shacklebolts and Shafiqs in the <em> Pure-blood
            Directory </em>).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s also worth noting that, while boys can&rsquo;t enter a girl&rsquo;s bedroom and there are separate
        lavatories for boys and girls, <b>the Quidditch changing rooms appear to be unisex</b>, as demonstrated by this
        passage from COS:&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly
            awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and tousle-haired, next to fourth year Alicia
            Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and
            Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><b>The Death Eaters are not going to turn on Voldemort because they found out that he&rsquo;s a Half-Blood.
        </b>They know he&rsquo;s a Half-blood already, and we know that they know this because we see Voldemort talk
        about his Muggle father and his father&rsquo;s grave in a very Muggle graveyard in GOF. This doesn&rsquo;t rule
        out the possibility that the Death Eaters are in denial about it all and slamming shots of Firewhiskey behind
        the scenes whenever they think about it (Bellatrix is 110% in denial), but either way, it isn&rsquo;t going to
        be news to them when Harry Potter starts dropping pamphlets in Diagon Alley or whatever. For Merlin&rsquo;s
        sake, when did &ldquo;the facts&rdquo; ever convince the fans of your least favorite politician that they were a
        berk? Don&rsquo;t expect wizard fascists to have a higher epistemic standard.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>The Wizengamot is probably not hereditary </b> &mdash; Ralston Potter and Henry Potter are the only Potters
        mentioned as being members, and we know enough about Fleamont and James (to say nothing of Harry) that we can
        expect to have heard about any seats on the Wizengamot that they might&rsquo;ve had. <b>The Sacred Twenty-eight
            are not a Who&rsquo;s Who of the Wizengamot </b> &mdash; they&rsquo;re a list of families assembled in the
        early 20th century by a single bigot, who specifically included or excluded some families because of how he
        personally felt. Also, <b>Lucius Malfoy is not a member of the Wizengamot.</b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Pure-bloods are more aware of the Muggle world than we often give them credit for.</b> Draco Malfoy certainly
        couldn&rsquo;t give you the technical specs for a helicopter, but even at the age of eleven, he did know that
        they were some sort of flying device and that they were quick enough that &ldquo;narrowly escaping&rdquo; one
        would be brag-worthy rather than embarrassing; and Kingsley Shacklebolt infiltrated the Muggle British
        government so well that he was regarded as one of the best members of the Prime Minister&rsquo;s staff in 1996,
        even though Prime Minister already knew about magic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Harry Potter was excited about the Triwizard Tournament and even by the prospect of being the Hogwarts
            champion </b> (until it <em> happened</em>, anyway). As <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/sjkc09/debunking_popular_fanon_the_triwizard_tournament/"
            rel="nofollow"> DeepSpaceCraft points out</a>, Harry also says, more or less and in front of witnesses,
        &ldquo;If I were going to put my name in the Goblet of Fire then I&rsquo;d do it when nobody was
        watching,&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s a bit of justification for other students to think that maybe, just maybe, he
        did just that.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that <em> the Fat Friar exists</em>, so &mdash; setting aside any arguments about
        the compatibility of magic and Christianity (see below for that) &mdash; <b>there has been at least one (1)
            wixen Christian in all of history</b>. This holds little import for determining <em> how many </em>wixen
        Christians there were or are, but I&rsquo;ve occasionally seen people posit that there have never been
        any.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>The Ministry (thinks that they) found more of Pettigrew than just his finger.</b> The confusion may be due to
        a difference between the film and book versions of POA. In the film, it&rsquo;s stated that a finger was
        &ldquo;all that was left,&rdquo; but in the book, we&rsquo;re told that a finger was &ldquo;the biggest bit of
        him they could find,&rdquo; meaning that there were other bits that (the Ministry believed) belonged to
        Pettigrew. Considering the explosion and the deaths of twelve Muggles, the scene was probably a little
        splatterpunk and the Ministry didn&rsquo;t bother to check which people-bits belonged to whom.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Gringotts is not the same thing as the &ldquo;goblin nation&rdquo;</strong> (which, as a term, does not
        show up in the books). The goblin rebellions do not imply that Gringotts is a nation any more than the American
        revolution implies that JPMorgan is a nation. It is also unclear whether there is a goblin state at all: the
        fact that there were goblin <em> rebellions </em> suggests that the Ministry of Magic was a dominant power, and
        it is plausible (though not certain or even probable) that there is no &ldquo;goblin government&rdquo; that is
        recognized by the Ministry or the I.C.W., as the Servile Wars do not imply that the slaves of Rome were a nation
        themselves, or constituted a government.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When Herbert Chorley, a junior minister in the Muggle government, was subjected to a &ldquo;poorly performed
        Imperius Curse,&rdquo; <strong>the Prime Minister did not suspect magic</strong>, even though he knew that magic
        existed.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is no restriction on the use of magic for wixes that have finished their term in Azkaban and returned to
        free society.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Aurors and Hit Wizards are probably the same thing (Hit Wizards are mentioned only in POA, and Aurors are
        mentioned only from GOF on).</p>
    <h2><a id="characters" rel="nofollow" name="characters"></a>Characters</h2>
    <p>Harry, Ron, and Hermione are never described as &ldquo;the Golden Trio.&rdquo; Even the word &ldquo;trio&rdquo;
        never shows up except for a single reference to the Deathly Hallows.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>We don&rsquo;t know whether <b>Regulus Black</b> was a &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; at the end or not. He
        might&rsquo;ve made a complete heel-face turn, or he could have just been a Pure-blood bigot who realized that
        Voldemort wasn&rsquo;t a selfless crusader for Pure-blood rights. Yes, he cared a lot for Kreacher, but <a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/23926540/chapters/57535792" rel="nofollow"> the same appears to be
            true of Bellatrix Black</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Susan Bones </b>lost an uncle, an aunt, and multiple cousins to Death Eaters, but her parents may still be
        alive. She probably doesn&rsquo;t live with her aunt Amelia, because she was alive even after the Death Eaters
        killed Amelia, but she could have easily been with a friend or something at the time.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Albus Dumbledore </b> wasn&rsquo;t certain that Voldemort had made a Horcrux until he had the Diary, and was
        only sure about <em> multiple </em> Horcruxes after Voldemort&rsquo;s resurrection, though the state of the
        Diary made multiple Horcruxes probable. Dumbledore also hoped that Harry would survive: the &ldquo;gleam of
        something like triumph in Dumbledore&rsquo;s eyes&rdquo; in GOF comes directly after Dumbledore learns that
        Voldemort&rsquo;s resurrection made use of Harry&rsquo;s blood, which was instrumental in keeping Harry alive.
        Also, he was very unconcerned with the prophecy, except to the extent that Voldemort's obsession with it made
        Voldemort more manageable. He only offered someone a sherbet lemon (or lemon drop, in American editions) once,
        and it was to Professor McGonagall.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Bellatrix Black</strong> may revere Voldemort but she doesn&rsquo;t accept his opinions uncritically,
        e.g. saying that &ldquo;The Dark Lord is&hellip; I believe&hellip; mistaken&rdquo; to trust Snape (though she is
        only willing to say so explicitly to Narcissa, and remains silent when Snape himself asks this).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Sirius Black</b> probably has a middle name, since his brother does, and it is very plausible that his middle
        name is Orion, after his father, just as his brother&rsquo;s middle name is Arcturus, after their grandfather.
        Nevertheless, we don&rsquo;t <em> know </em> either of these for a fact, so feel free to do what you want and
        still call the fic &ldquo;canon compliant.&rdquo;</p>
    <p><strong>Cornelius Fudge</strong> believed that Voldemort could &ldquo;rise again&rdquo; if Sirius Black found
        him, so the idea that Voldemort was still around in some sense was not unimaginable.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Nobody refers to <b>Hermione Granger </b>as &lsquo;Mione. She knows how to fly a broomstick. Her parents are not
        necessarily named Dan and Emma. She's kind of socially inadept in her first year at Hogwarts, but <a
            href="https://slashmarks.tumblr.com/post/733823021216841728/hermione-granger" rel="nofollow">outgrows that
            over time</a>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Luna Lovegood </b>is neither a Seer nor an untrained Legilimens. The primary difference between Luna Lovegood
        and Alex Jones is a pleasanter disposition (well, that and the genuineness of their beliefs).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Remus Lupin </b>is not obsessed with chocolate.</p>
    <p><b>Abraxas Malfoy</b> was not necessarily a Death Eater, and did not necessarily go to school with Tom Riddle.
    </p>
    <p><b>Harry Potter </b>is not called &ldquo;cub&rdquo; or &ldquo;pup&rdquo; or anything similar, nor is he called
        anybody's "golden boy." His grandparents are Fleamont and Euphemia, not Charlus and Dorea. He does not have
        "Avada Kedavra orbs."&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>James Potter </b>was Head Boy and Chaser on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, but he is not specifically stated
        to have either been a prefect or Quidditch captain.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Severus Snape </b>is not Draco Malfoy&rsquo;s godfather, or at least he isn&rsquo;t said to be. For the
        record, nobody is anybody&rsquo;s godfather except for Sirius Black (Harry Potter) and Harry himself (Ted
        Lupin); but Bill Weasley appears to be familiar with the concept, so...&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Arthur Weasley&rsquo;s </b> ignorance of many Muggle things is not so much a problem as we might think.
        It&rsquo;s true that he handles Muggle artifacts, but this doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that he directly
        interacts with Muggles, except in situations where the Muggles are going to be Obliviated later. He
        doesn&rsquo;t need to know how to speak on a telephone, only that Muggle telephones aren&rsquo;t supposed to
        bite your ear off, and given that it&rsquo;s possible to detect enchantments he may not even need to know that
        much. Kingsley Shacklebolt on the other hand was able to operate undetected on the Prime Minister&rsquo;s staff,
        and the Muggle Liaison Office can be expected to have greater familiarity with the Muggle world, and even they
        might not know exactly how an electric plug works. There are plenty of <em> Muggles </em>that don&rsquo;t
        know.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It also isn't clear how much of his ignorance is just for show. When the subject comes up with a fellow adult at
        his workplace, rather than with some kid, Arthur demonstrates a familiarity with the technical vocabulary:&nbsp;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Then he said in normal tones, &ldquo;And don&rsquo;t take too long, Weasley, the delay on that firelegs
            report held our investigation up for a month.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>&ldquo;If you had read my report you would know that the term is &lsquo;firearms,&rsquo; &rdquo; said Mr.
            Weasley coolly. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to wait for information on motorcycles,
            we&rsquo;re extremely busy at the moment.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We can't be sure whether Kingsley feigned ignorance for the sake of their pretend conversation (if so, he must be
        a quick study in order to, as mentioned above, fool even the Prime Minister), but Arthur clearly knows what he's
        talking about.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Also worth noting vis-&agrave;-vis &ldquo;Tell me, what exactly is the function of a rubber duck?&rdquo;:</p>
    <p>(1) Arthur only asks this question in the film adaptation of COS.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>(2) On 10 January 1992, more than 20,000 rubber ducks were dumped overboard from a cargo ship in the Pacific
        Ocean, and from that time the ducks have been used to track ocean currents and confirm and refine existing
        models. Harry doesn&rsquo;t show up at the Burrow until July 1992, so Arthur very well might have heard about
        this by the time that he asks Harry what&rsquo;s up with rubber ducks.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Fred and George Weasley</b> are probably the only Weasley twins in living memory, and there is no indication
        that Fabian and Gideon Prewett were twins. Fraternal twins run in families, but identical twins do not (this
        might be different where magic is involved, though). They only made the &ldquo;Gred and Forge&rdquo; joke a
        single time.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Molly Weasley</strong> did not necessarily dose Arthur with a love potion and, if she ever had done so,
        the love potion was not necessarily Amortentia. There are many kinds of love potion, of which Amortentia is
        the&nbsp;<em>strongest</em>, not the most typical. If there were anything shady about what Molly had done, she
        probably wouldn't be telling the story at the breakfast table. She might have used the love potion on someone
        else, the use of the love potion might have been consensual (there are plenty of reasons that you might be
        willing to drink a love potion), and the love potion may have had relatively minor effects (the love potion
        which Ron is accidentally dosed with, for example, is no more severe than a Confundus Charm, and there's nothing
        to suggest that Ron would have done anything more than "act very silly as he proclaims his love for
        Romilda").&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Percy Weasley</b> is not named &ldquo;Percival.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If you hate <b>Ron Weasley </b>and you haven&rsquo;t read the books in a few years, then I strongly encourage you
        to reread them. That might not change your position, but it&rsquo;s a fact that (1) the films portray him in a
        worse light than the books and (2) the films sometimes influence our sense of canon more than we realize (just
        think about how many people talk about Arthur Weasley&rsquo;s &ldquo;rubber duck obsession&rdquo; as if this is
        something that ever comes up in the books). He&rsquo;s certainly not dumb, since he got as many O.W.L.s as Harry
        did.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some observations on the relative heights of certain characters:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In <em>Goblet of Fire</em>, Charlie, Fred, and George are &ldquo;shorter and stockier&rdquo; than Ron
            already is at the age of 14.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>In <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, when various characters take Polyjuice to assume Harry's appearance, Hermione
            is "shooting upward" and Ron, Fred, and George are "shrinking."&nbsp;</li>
        <li>In&nbsp;<em>Deathly Hallows</em>, Draco is "slightly taller" than Harry. In&nbsp;<em>Half-blood Prince</em>,
            Draco is as tall as Narcissa. In&nbsp;<em>Goblet of Fire</em>, Narcissa is simply described as "tall."&nbsp;
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore, by <em>Deathly Hallows</em>, Draco is tall, Harry is <em>probably</em> tall but not so much as Draco,
        Fred and George may be a little taller than Draco, and Ron is the tallest of them all. There may be an
        inconsistency between "Fred and George are short and stocky" and "Fred and George are taller than Harry," since
        Harry can't be short if Draco is both "tall" and only "slightly taller" than Harry, but maybe wizards are just
        built different. Fleur is also about as tall as Harry, because she neither shoots upward nor shrinks when she
        takes the Polyjuice.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Hogwarts</h2>
    <p>Hogwarts letters are sent in July, not on the student&rsquo;s birthday. Letters were being sent to Harry days
        before his birthday, but he finally read his letter on his birthday because that&rsquo;s when Hagrid arrived and
        forced the issue. In fact, the cut-off date for a <em> reply </em>is on Harry&rsquo;s birthday.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The school uniform is robes (black) and a pointed hat (also black, for day wear), and a winter cloak (black, with
        silver fastenings), and all clothes are supposed to carry name tags. There is no mention of neckties, nor
        anything that might portray a student&rsquo;s house in the normal course of things. Quidditch team robes are
        colored differently, but it&rsquo;s a tiny plot point in COS that, while Polyjuiced, Harry and Ron mistakenly
        ask a Ravenclaw for directions to the Slytherin common room.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Charms Master,&rdquo; &ldquo;Potions Master,&rdquo; and so forth do not refer to a &ldquo;mastery&rdquo;
        in the sense that a Master&rsquo;s degree refers to an additional educational attainment. It is simply a(n
        old-fashioned) way of saying &ldquo;Charms teacher,&rdquo; &ldquo;Potions teacher,&rdquo; etc. John Nettleship,
        for example, was Rowling&rsquo;s Chemistry master.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Minerva McGonagall doesn&rsquo;t give welcoming speeches to new Gryffindors. Whether the other Heads do anything
        to welcome new students is unknown.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; &ldquo;E,&rdquo; and other letter grades are unique to the O.W.L. and N.E.W.T. tests.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Yule Ball was a special dance that occurs in tandem with the Triwizard Tournament, and not an annual event.
        The <em> Magic Awakened </em> game says that the Yule Ball was popular enough that it inspired the scheduling of
        annual dances in years to come, which is a fun idea, but you can take that or leave it as you please.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Magic</h2>
    <p>In terms of comparing magic to Muggle science, <strong>it&rsquo;s better to think of wixes as &ldquo;differently
            sophisticated&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;less sophisticated.&rdquo;</strong> Technology doesn&rsquo;t advance
        through discrete tech levels which manifest everywhere in the same way, but rather adapts to the culture which
        uses it (just as the culture adapts to knock-on effects of that technology). Rather than saying, &ldquo;Wixes
        don&rsquo;t have cell phones, so they&rsquo;re technologically backwards,&rdquo; we ought to remember that a
        fifteen-year-old student once built a pager network out of magical coins and two kids in the 1980s owned a pair
        of looking-glass mobile videophones more than a decade before Muggles had anything similar, and conclude that
        maybe Magical Britain just doesn&rsquo;t <em> care much </em> about that shit (perhaps the ease of personal and
        fireplace-based teleportation means that they continue to prefer in-person interaction).&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>The effect of magic on Muggle technology is often overblown.</strong> This idea is founded in
        Hermione&rsquo;s comment in GOF that &ldquo;all those substitutes for magic Muggles use &mdash; electricity,
        computers, and radar, and all those things &mdash; they all go haywire around Hogwarts, there&rsquo;s too much
        magic in the air.&rdquo; First, all three of these rely on the electromagnetic spectrum, so things like
        &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; and &ldquo;combustion engines&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaccines&rdquo; will still work just fine.
        Second, if wixes themselves produced an appreciable anti-tech field then Hermione would certainly have mentioned
        that, because she&rsquo;s explaining why Rita Skeeter couldn&rsquo;t have gotten her information from a Muggle
        listening device, and it makes no sense to talk about Hogwarts if Rita&rsquo;s victims would have fucked with
        her hypothetical bug all by themselves. While we&rsquo;re on the subject of combustion engines, by the way,
        I&rsquo;d like to mention that while that the engine, specifically, has naught to do with electricity, the spark
        plug <em> does</em>, so a Muggle car would probably be able to drive by Hogwarts but might have some trouble
        <em> starting up </em> nearby Hogwarts).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You do not need to have visited a location in order to Apparate there, though a prior visit or even a photograph
        will probably assist in the &ldquo;Destination&rdquo; element of the three D&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Transfiguration is generally permanent, or at least can be made permanent by a competent wix and not just an
        expert one (this statement has nothing to do with the possibility of performing an untransfiguration).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is no method to permanently block, remove, or suppress a wix&rsquo;s magic, which is a major reason why
        Azkaban is patrolled by dementors and why wixes can break out of Azkaban and subsequently cause trouble.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>The Killing Curse can be blocked by at least some physical objects, as when it &ldquo;merely glanced off&rdquo;
        the chest of a golden statue. Perhaps the gold of the statue, or its animation, or some other magical quality,
        was responsible, but something happened.&nbsp;</p>

            Aren&rsquo;t Canon)</a>,&rdquo; by Lunanight, is exactly what it sounds like. So much debate about magical
        cores comes down to the fucking Boat Scene.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is Dark magic (and there are Dark Arts), but no such thing as Light magic (nor Light Arts).&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Pepper-up Potion treats colds, not fatigue (though they might help fatigue to whatever degree that &ldquo;getting
        a bit warmer&rdquo; will or won&rsquo;t help).</p>
    <p>Animagus forms and Patronuses don&rsquo;t have to match, and probably don&rsquo;t most of the time.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Wixes have pets, not familiars.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>The incompetence of adult wixes in re Shield Charms is probably overstated.</strong> That is to say, they
        probably aren&rsquo;t good at Shield Charms, but we shouldn&rsquo;t use that fact to draw any conclusions about
        their magical competency in general. Consider the following:&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li>George says that many people can&rsquo;t cast a <em>decent</em> Shield Charm, implying that they&rsquo;re
            capable of casting one at all.</li>
        <li>Fred says that the Ministry purchased Shield Hats for their <em>support staff</em>, which rules out the
            interpretation that e.g. most Hit-wizards cannot cast a decent Shield Charm.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>George suggests that their own competence with the Shield Charm is due to Harry&rsquo;s teaching.</li>
        <li>We never seen anyone learn the Shield Charm in class: Harry studies it on his own in fourth year, as part of
            his preparations for the Triwizard Tournament, and fifth year, he teaches it to the D.A.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>George credits his and Fred&rsquo;s expertise with the Shield Charm to Harry&rsquo;s teaching, as stated
            above.</li>
        <li>Snape does not teach the Shield Charm in Harry&rsquo;s sixth year.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Given these facts, it is plausible that the Shield Charm is not taught until seventh year, or even that it is not
        a part of the core curriculum at all. It might receive a week or two of attention, then get occasional
        reinforcement in subsequent lessons but nothing substantial. Even if it is normally taught and greatly
        emphasized in sixth year it would be part of the N.E.W.T. curriculum, which means that only D.A.D.A. N.E.W.T.
        students will learn it.&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Fanon Names for Canon Things</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>&ldquo;Dreamless Sleep Potion&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have a name (but the fanonical name is as good as
            any).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Extension Charms do exist, and they do make things bigger on the inside than they are on the outside, but
            these &ldquo;extended spaces&rdquo; are only called &ldquo;wizardspace&rdquo; in fan works. There is no
            canonical term for them. &ldquo;<a

                Whither Wizard Space?</a>&rdquo; is an essay that I wrote on the topic.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>The term &ldquo;ward&rdquo; is never used in canon, but spells that could be described as wards, such as the
            Anti-Apparition Charm, do exist.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Pure Fanon</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>"Compulsion" spells, other than the Imperius Curse.</li>
        <li>The &ldquo;Tempus&rdquo; spell is not canonical; &ldquo;<a
                href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/34582246/chapters/86084446#workskin" rel="nofollow">Tempus in a
                Teacup</a>&rdquo; is a mini-essay that I wrote on its history in fanfiction.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Warming Charms do not exist (but Hot Air Charms do).&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Wizarding oaths, especially of the variety that go "so mote it be."&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Reality</h1>
    <p><b>It&rsquo;s a common misconception that Tom Riddle experienced the Blitz</b>, but the Blitz took place from 7
        September 1940 to 11 May 1941, while Tom was safely ensconced at Hogwarts. It&rsquo;s completely fine for the
        Blitz to have affected him in the way that writers often describe &mdash; upon his return, Tom would have been
        greeted with the physical evidence, hundreds of thousands of tons of rubble, and horror stories that were
        already transforming into legend &mdash; but he would not have personally experienced it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>Medieval European Christianity was not strongly prejudiced against wizards</b>, and this goes double for
        Catholicism. The majority of witch hunts were (1) post-Middle Ages and (2) perpetrated by Protestants. Some
        forms of magic were banned (usually divination, or some specific variety of divination) but others were
        permitted.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>An example of the complicated portrait of these times is the Council of Paderborn in A.D. 785, which made the act
        of witch-burning a crime in itself, and punishable by death (because witch-burning was witch-killing and
        witch-killing was murder), though it should be noted that Charlemagne <em> didn&rsquo;t think that witches
            existed</em>, and there could be (less lethal) punishments for holding a belief to the contrary. The real
        Charlemagne was obviously correct to say that magic doesn&rsquo;t actually exist, but this&nbsp; situation does
        make for a thorny problem when we try to account for the Council of Paderborn in a world where magic very much
        did exist. Perhaps Charlemagne disbelieved in witches in the sense of &ldquo;persons who acquired their magical
        power through a deal with the Devil,&rdquo; which is close enough to the sort of witch that he was certainly
        talking about in our world.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the British Isles, witch hunts were fiercest in Scotland and almost nonexist in Ireland. Even so, it might be
        going too far to say that Scottish wixes all hate religion or something like that. Witch hunts rarely occur in
        isolation, and at the same time that the Muggle Scots were persecuting witches, they also were persecuting e.g.
        Catholics, so a Scottish wizard might not see anything incongruous about being both a wizard and a Catholic. In
        fact, because Catholicism was often being driven underground across Great Britain during the period preceding
        the Statute, we might expect Catholicism to be more common in magical families.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b>The situation is more complicated with regard to Judaism. </b>As the saying goes, wherever there are two
        rabbis, you will find three opinions. Some will say that everything that is magical is an affront to God, and
        there are others who will say that spellcasting is no different from any other inborn art. Some people can
        wiggle their ears, and other people can throw fireballs (just&hellip;not on the Sabbath, please). It&rsquo;s
        relatively certain that, whatever restrictions are in place, most or all of them go out the window if
        somebody&rsquo;s life is at stake, but where this is the case, there must be at least one specific person, not
        just a general theoretical entity, whose life is to be saved. If Judaism is going to play a major role in your
        story then I really, really recommend that you do some research and/or find a Jewish beta reader (or two, or
        three). This paragraph is just to clear up some common misconceptions.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The British are not so religious as Americans, and Evangelicals and Fundamentalists are much rarer. <b>You are
            especially unlikely to see anything to do with exorcisms</b>, especially when Tom Riddle lived at
        Wool&rsquo;s Orphanage (neither the Church of England nor the Catholic Church were keen on exorcisms at that
        time), and <em> modern </em> exorcisms are generally more sedate than Hollywood films might&rsquo;ve led you to
        believe. They also include visits by a psychiatrist to make sure that the supposed victim of possession
        isn&rsquo;t just in need of medical care.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Speaking of Wool&rsquo;s Orphanage: <b>Institutions like Wool&rsquo;s were phased out in the 1950s </b>and no
        longer exist. Sad as it is, Harry Potter cannot grow up in an orphanage &agrave; la Charles Dickens. Also the
        legal precedent for fostering children was established in 1926, with the Adoption of Children Act. Generally,
        the one fostering a child or infant would be required to be at least 25, unrelated, and&nbsp; a resident of the
        UK. And no, the one fostering the child cannot be a sole male, unless said law was updated, if the infant/child
        is female. Consent has to be acquired from both parties, specifically the parent of the child and the one who is
        adopting the child. The welfare of the child is paramount and the applicant cannot be offered payment to take in
        said child.</p>
    <p>Many people make too much of Pure-blood inbreeding. <strong>The level of intermarriage that we see in most
            British Pure-blood families is mostly fine from a genetic health standpoint.</strong> At most, just five
        hundred people are needed to prevent the most deleterious effects of inbreeding, and several estimates are much
        lower than that. You mostly see Hapsburg-like extremes where people are consistently marrying first cousins and
        closer relations (children, parents, aunts and uncles). This isn&rsquo;t to say that a small population that
        consistently practices intermarriage will get off without any side effects, though: Ashkenazi Jews and Old Order
        Amish both have a greater risk of acquiring Tay-Sachs disease, for example. More benign effects include the
        blueish skin of the Blue Fugates of Kentucky and the deafness that once was prevalent on Martha&rsquo;s
        Vineyard. In &ldquo;<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/16940712/chapters/39807054"
            rel="nofollow">Certain Dark Things</a>,&rdquo; by rentachi, motion sickness (which indeed can run in
        families) is associated with very Pure-blooded families like the Blacks. It is worth noting a certain
        <em>lack</em> of inbreeding is responsible for the spread of hemophilia across the royal houses of Europe: the
        "Hemophilia B" gene mostly likely originated as a "spontaneous mutation" in either Queen Victoria or her father,
        and was manifested in her grandchildren and further descendants because it was a dominant gene, rather than
        because her relatives were marrying close cousins or anything like that.&nbsp;</p>
