    <h2>Chapter Summary</h2>
    <p>Symbols for British wizarding currency. Thoughts about how a magical economy might function, and the assumptions
        that go into that, as well as speculation about the role that Gringotts plays in all of this (and why it plays
        that role at all).<br />
        <b>The Price of Transfiguration:</b> How the magical economy handles the existence of (canonically permanent)
        transfiguration.<br />
        <b>A Matter of Sport:</b> Different figures on the number of Quidditch players in Magical Britain, how many of
        them are professional players (and what that might mean in a magical economy), and how less-popular sports might
        function.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>My own thinking, just to get it out of the way, is that the magical economy is radically different from the
        muggle economy:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p dir="ltr">1.1 Transfigurations are generally permanent, so the supply of materially-finished goods is limited
            to the ability of an individual wix to transfigure those goods.</p>

        <p>1.2 Even assuming that personal talent (both creative and magical) determines the quality of a set of
            transfigured robes, this still means that “magical manufacturing” is very different to muggle
            manufacturing.</p>

        <p>1.3 Anti-Theft Charms exist in canon, and we can easily suppose the existence of other enchantments, perhaps
            to prevent staining, extend use-life, and so forth. All, or almost all, goods in the magical world are
            enchanted in this way.</p>

        <p>1.4 Magic (and magical properties) cannot be created through transfiguration, so you cannot transfigure a
            stone into a unicorn tail.</p>

        <p>1.5 Therefore, when you buy an item in Diagon Alley, you are paying for (1) the creative and magical
            craftsmanship required to produce the item, (2) the cost of any magical components which might exist, and
            (3) any enchantments which were laid upon the item.</p>

        <p>2.1 If transfigurations are not permanent (which is the case in many fanfics), then the shape of the economy
            is still distorted by the way that wixes can enchant objects to move on their own, permitting a degree of
            automation whose only bottlenecks are (1) the number of tools which a wix can animate at a given time and
            (2) the rate at which a near-finished item can be enchanted and thereby completed.</p>

        <p>2.2 Despite the impossibility of transfiguring non-food into food, the ability to animate even a single tool
            at one time would have a dramatic effect on farming. Imagine, for example, being able to plow a field
            without relying on animal power, or enchanting a bag of seeds to float over a feed and scatter its contents
            across the furrows.</p>

    <p>In “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/14367483/chapters/33167958" rel="nofollow">Lady Archimedes</a>,”
        by White_Squirrel, there is a tax on extra wands.</p>
    <h1>Gringotts and Currency</h1>
    <p>The symbol ʛ is canonically used to refer to galleons. There are symbols for sickles and knuts as well, but they
        don't exist in unicode. ⨎ (or ʢ) and ⁂ (or ∴ or ⸫) are sorta close to the canonical symbols, though. For reasons
        unknown to me, wemyss used Γ., ſ., and ĸ. for galleons, sickles, and knuts.</p>

    <p>One downside to bimetallic currencies is that people can profit from exploiting the difference between the
        exchange rate of the two currencies and the actual availability of the substances which are converted into those
        currencies. If we allow for a strong distinction between plain gold and gold <em> galleons</em>, however, then
        solving this problem is straightforward, however: goblins make galleons (and sickles and knuts); goblin magic
        can distinguish between goblin-made galleons and galleons of another provenance; and goblins make galleons,
        sickles, and knuts in amounts that are proportionate to the exchange rate.</p>

    <p>“<a href="https://wemyss.livejournal.com/182444.html" rel="nofollow">Gnomes are from Zurich, Goblins are from
            Vienna</a>,” by wemyss, presents a common view of Gringotts and the economy: the bank has a full reserve,
        engages only moderately in loan services if it engages at all, charges for security vaults, takes a cut of the
        money that it mints, and perhaps makes a profit from other activities.</p>

    <p>The second chapter of “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13646271/chapters/64343005#workskin"
            rel="nofollow">What's in a Name: Headcanons and Geekery</a>,” by LadyAramisGrey, discusses the
        galleons-to-pounds exchange rate, possibly goblin uses for muggle currency, (the relative lack of) inflation,
        and prices, prices, more prices, and wages. It suggests the nonexistence of a property tax but possibly taxes
        for inheriting property or converting muggle property to magical property, and that apothecaries might also
        stock spices and ingredients for cooking meals as well as for brewing potions. There's also some interesting
        discussion about the Weasleys and Dobby, with respect to wages and cost of living.</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>Overall, the cost of monthly living for a wizard or witch who owns property but potentially doesn't have a
            comprehensive garden or livestock would appear to be around 80ʛ 8ʢ 8⸫ (food + basic clothing/2 outfits and
            cloak + transport/2 daily trips + entertainment). Double it for a spouse. Add another 45 monthly galleons
            for food and clothing with each child and an extra hundred galleons for every child sent to Hogwarts. [...]
        </p>

        <p>Minimum wage to survive on our calculated monthly cost of living could be as low as 50ʛ per month
            (12-13ʛ/week) but the ideal average would be around 20ʛ/week. Naturally if you don't own property and are
            renting in the London Wizarding District, you would probably prefer a higher wage. [...]</p>

        <p>Using this as a model, I would say one galleon is equivalent to about £10 to £12 or about $16 to $20 USD in
            2020 money based on equivalent items in the US and the UK. This would make a sickle (1ʢ), which is 0.05882
            of a galleon, equivalent to about £0.65 or $1.06, and a knut (1⸫), which is 0.002028 of a galleon would be
            somewhere in the range of £0.02 or $0.04 USD.</p>

    <h1>The Price of Transfiguration</h1>
    <p>Muggles pay for a number of things when they purchase something: the raw material, the effort and expertise
        required to obtain that material and transform it into the end product, and other bullshit like advertising.
        From this perspective, it's arguable that the magical economy is (contrary to what I've said earlier) actually
        not all that different from the muggle economy.</p>

    <p>Transfiguration doesn't seem to be strongly limited by the relative sizes of the target object and what you
        intend to transform it into, but most “thing-to-thing” transfigurations involve objects of approximately similar
        size and it does appear that transfiguration of larger objects is harder than the transfiguration of smaller
        objects. I think it's reasonable to conclude that increasing the mass of an object through transfiguration,
        while not impossible, is more difficult than a transfiguration which involves no change in mass. On the same
        principle (“What can we reasonably infer, even if it wasn't spelled out and Rowling possibly didn't mean to
        imply it?”), it is easier to perform transfigurations between objects that are more similar to each other.</p>

    <p>In fact, we could use similarity as a general underlying principle: two objects of the same size are similar in
        mass (or spatial dimensions, depending on how you'd like to define size), and objects may also be similar in
        terms of both being organisms, or felines, or housecats (this seems strongly implied but I don't remember
        whether it was made explicit in the books). The greater the number of points of similarity, and the greater the
        degree of similarity in each case, the simpler the transfiguration, with the simplest possible operation being a
        transfiguration of an object into itself. The upshot is that most materials will be transfigured from a simpler
        substance, but wixes won't just transfigure everything from dirt (or even the air).</p>

    <p>Let's introduce another principle: it is easier to duplicate an object than to create a new one. Canonically,
        duplicates produced from the Doubling Charm are imperfect, and decay more quickly even if they are not
        immediately distinguishable from the original. You can choose to take this and run with it, but if you want to
        allow for physically perfect duplicates then there's another option, courtesy of “<a
            href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy" rel="nofollow">Potter
            Who and the Wossname's Thingummy</a>,” by ForrestUUID:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>“Those coins of yours. My dad finally got the Wixell tests back. If you want to sell them, he'll buy them.
            The Fugio cent has a duplicate somewhere, which cuts its value except to the owner of the other. The dime is
            unique.”</p>

        <p>“What are Wixell tests?”</p>

        <p>“Nodality — that's a transfigurational copy check — grade enhancement illusion and…well, no offense, you
            found them, if you can't trust Harry Potter who <em> can </em> you trust, but he had to verify they weren't
            stolen by somebody else.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It should also be noted that conjuring or transfiguring “magic” appears to be impossible, which is to say that
        you can only obtain the exact effect of a particular spell by <em> casting </em> that spell. This is why,
        despite the difficulty of hunting Demiguises, high-quality Invisibility Cloaks are produced from actual
        Demiguises rather than by transfiguring other objects into Demiguise hides. This being so, it's probably also
        the case that specific animals will be raised for parchment (and other things) in order to exploit magical
        qualities that are easier to obtain by this process than by laying enchantments.</p>

    <p>Wixell Tests work pretty well for my personal canon, which permits (at least in theory) the perfect duplication
        of anything, even food (as Hermione explains in DH, you can increase the quantity of food if you've got some)
        and “quantity” is just another characteristic of an object, like color or mass, that can be altered through
        transfiguration. Because an object whose quantity has been altered is still one object (just with multiple
        physical instances), they still have a metaphysical connection that a Wixell Test could take advantage of.</p>

    <p>Thrifty wixes probably won't care whether their coat is a duplicate, but you can be sure that the Malfoys have a
        Certificate of Uniqueness (Certificate Sui Generis?) for every last item in their possession, and even if you
        don't go that far, it's probably a low-class sort of thing to intentionally purchase duplicated goods (The price
        difference probably isn't as much as you imagine. If it's impossible to produce a magical property simply
        through transfiguration or duplication then each duplicated item will have to be enchanted just the same as the
        original, so you're only saving on the physical craftsmanship of the piece).</p>
    <h2>Wizarding Fashion</h2>
    <p>Clothing might have any of the following enchantments:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Anti-Theft charms to prevent anybody but the proper owner (and perhaps others, if allowed) from Summoning
            the clothing.</li>
        <li>Charms to keep away soot and grime, and to prevent staining.</li>
        <li>Charm to keep ashes and Floo powder off.</li>
        <li>Colorfast and Lightfast charms to prevent the dyes from running or fading, respectively.</li>
        <li>Deweighting charms to soften the material.</li>
        <li>Lastingness charms to prevent minor wear-and-tear.</li>
        <li>Water-proofing charms to prevent moisture damage and keep one&rsquo;s clothes from getting wet to start
            with.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Shoes might be charmed to keep their shine, and bear a Self-lacing Charm. </p>
    <h1>A Matter of Sport</h1>
    <p>If we assume that there are 20,000 wixes in Britain and that only professional Quidditch players qualify as
        “professional athletes,” then there are 91-182 professional Quidditch players in the British and Irish Quidditch
        League (thirteen teams, each with seven players and an unknown number of reservists, who may or may not be
        merely semiprofessional). For comparison, there were roughly 12,600 professional athletes in the United Kingdom
        in 2010, or 0.46% vs 0.02% of their respective populations.</p>

    <p>In other words, the relative proportion of professional athletes in Magical Britain is twenty-three times greater
        than in the United Kingdom, and we can assume that the difference is that much greater if we count other kinds
        of athletes besides Quidditch players. There are two non-mutually exclusive explanations for the imbalance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The economic situations of Magical Britain and the United Kingdom are sufficiently different to permit a
            much larger population of professional athletes, comprising perhaps as much as 1% of the overall population
            (and 2-3% of the working population).</li>
        <li>“Professional” Quidditch players (and/or other athletes) are better-described as “semi-professional” in
            muggle terms: they have side jobs or some other source of income. If there's a great gulf of support between
            Quidditch and other sports then it may be that Quidditch players are truly professional but most reservists
            and other athletes are semi-professional or even amateur.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In either case, if you really want to dig into this side of Magical Britain, then it may be worth looking at
        professional players of less-popular games, like chess, fencing, and Scrabble, where overall incomes are lower
        and often depend on winning competitions (the worst professional football team to compete in the World Cup still
        gets paid, but the fourth-best fencer to compete in the World Championship gets nada). It's not uncommon for
        these players to reside in places with a low cost of living or even to be fully itinerant as they travel from
        one competition to another. Chess players can also make money from appearance fees, sponsorships, writing,
        coaching, working in related organizations, and acquiring scholarships and stipends, most of which are also
        options for Quidditch players.</p>

    <p>I don't spend much time on this aspect of dueling, but in my series “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368" rel="nofollow">There is Nothing to Fear</a>,” professional
        duelists expect to compete at least throughout Europe, and when Tom Riddle embarks on a Grand Tour of the world
        following his graduation from Hogwarts, his itinerary is influenced by the dueling circuit, a pretty well-worn
        set of dueling competitions whose location and timing take into account the need to give duelists from one
        competition enough time to travel to the next. There are regional and global circuits, and the regional circuits
        aren't in sync with each other, but they're all synced with the global circuit.</p>

    <p>Amid all this talk of sport teams and demographics, it is worth noting that Liechtenstein has seven professional
        football teams, despite a population just shy of 40,000 (though it is also worth noting that these teams
        regularly play in neighboring Switzerland).</p>
    <h1>Occupations</h1>
    <h2>Historical Occupations</h2>
    <p><strike>Ireland</strike>
    <p><b>Colorators applied color</b> , especially to textiles or black-and-white photographs (these are separate
        occupations with similar objectives and the same name). Other names include <em> dexter </em> (textiles), <em>
            faker </em> (photographs), and <em> tinter </em> (either). The <b>dyes might be prepared</b> by a
        color-witch or color-wizard.</p>

    <p><b>Fly coaches </b> were hired by the hour, and <b>glass coaches </b>by the day. I like the idea of generalizing
        this to e.g. glass-wizards are laborers who are hired and paid by the day, and might be called glass-dockers,
        etc., according to their line of work.</p>

    <p><b>Lamp exhausters </b>drained the air from lightbulbs, back when that was a thing that had to be done. Perhaps
        the magical sort interfere with Muggle devices.</p>

    <p>In Muggle history, <b>owlers</b> smuggled wool or sheep between England and France, but magical owlers should
        probably smuggle owls. Other smugglers were called smugsmiths.</p>

    <p>People who <b>sold goods door-to-door or on the street</b> (usually from carts or stalls) were called hawkers,
        higglers (perhaps from “haggle”), hucksters (or huxters), and peddlers. Hucksters got their modern poor
        reputation because they were known to sell cheap, even shoddy goods. Sellers of produce were also called
        costermongers and greengrocers,</p>

    <p>The term “hawker” and the suffix “-monger” were used broadly for <b>sellers of certain goods</b>, i.e. fish was
        sold by fish hawkers and fishmongers. Presumably, a seller of hawks was a hawk hawker. The -monger suffix often
        has a negative connotation: we talk of rumormongers and whoremongers today, but not of truthmongers, and we do
        talk of “peacemongers,” but usually not in a complimentary way. The place where the -monger sells their goods is
        a -mongery, i.e. fishmongery, ironmongery. “Lightmongers” installed rather than sold lighting.</p>

    <p>In the period leading up to the Statute of Secrecy, the Catholic Church was remarkably lenient toward prostitutes
        &ndash; Augustine, Aquinas, and other Church Fathers did not exactly <i>approve</i> of sex work, but they
        tolerated it, and in some parts of England the bishops and other church authorities expressly supported it. The
        Tudor monarchs (r. late 15th and 16th centuries) were notably stricter, but following the restoration of the
        English monarchy in 1660 laxness was again the order of the day. If
        we follow the model of Medieval and premodern England, it would be plausible to see regular inspections,
        limitations on where prostitutes can work and how they can dress, worker protections
        (including a limit on how much a brothel could charge its prostitutes for their rooms).</p>
    <h2>Magical Occupations</h2>
    <p>First of all, we know that there are people in the service industry, such as bartenders, servers, and waiters;
        store staff, such as cashiers and saleswixes; and there are people involved in communication and journalism,
        like broadcasters, columnists, and photographers. There are enough actors for a Wizarding Academy of Dramatic
        Arts, and there are comedians, dancers, musicians, and other entertainers, as well as special effects wixes who
        work in the theater.</p>

    <p>There are also people involved in the making and selling of brooms, who we might call (in old-fashioned terms)
        broom squires and broom dashers, respectively. There are farmers, who grow plants for potion-supplies, as well
        as trees for broomsticks and wands. There are tutors for magical children not yet old enough to go to Hogwarts,
        and there may be tutors for that subset of children who never go to Hogwarts. There are Healers; and there are
        mediwitches or mediwizards, who may be the same thing, or a subset specializing in traumatic injuries or first
        response.</p>

    <p>Magenta Cornstock was an “experimental artist,” and this probably just means “artist who did weird stuff,” but
        there are talking portraits and moving photographs, so perhaps it could also involve actual research and
        experimentation. In any case, there are other researchers as well: Aurologists (who, in the film canon, study
        auras), Dragonologists, and Herbologists among them.</p>

    <p>The terms “mechanic” and “technician” feel awfully Muggle, but they point to occupations that would have a
        presence in Magical Britain and I think it would be useful to have a general term for somebody that maintains
        and repairs objects of a magical nature. Right now I like <em> mystician</em>, which sounds like “magician” and
        implies an initiation into secret lore (the sacred mysteries of installing and repairing magical HVAC systems).
    </p>

    <p>The OE defines <em> arcanist </em> as "a person who has knowledge of a secret process of manufacture.” The Old
        English “hellruna” referred to a person who performed necromancy, speaking with the dead for the purpose of
        divination; today, the term would be <em> hellrune</em>.</p>

    <p>There's certainly a need for magical pest exterminators.</p>

    <p>British wizards like their watches and clocks, so there are probably people who specialize in making clocks and
        watchers (I like the term “horologer”).</p>

    <p>On Reddit, there have been many interesting suggestions:

        noted that Muggles could be the focus of professions besides Obliviators, the Muggle-worthy Excuses Committee,
        and other employees of the Ministry, such as <i>surveyors</i>, who check and alter Muggle records to make sure
        that eyebrows won't be raised when you magically conceal an entire townhouse (cough Grimmauld Place cough); and
        <i>distancers</i>, who keep the Muggles out of your hair, whether the neighbor kids are being rude to your
        children or a company wants to build its next factory in your backyard.

    <p>In the “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/2866324" rel="nofollow">Victoria Potter</a>” series by the
        Artist Formerly Known as Taure, there are several magical platforms at King's Cross: Platform 7 ½ (to
        Constantinople, in 1991), Platform 8 ½ (to Hogwarts, in 1992), and Platform 9 ¾ (to Hogwarts, in 1991; to
        Tromsø, in 1992). I like this, because trains are great and there should be more of them. It also provides
        another method of international travel and gives Platform 9 ¾ something more to do when the Hogwarts Express
        isn't running.</p>

            rel="nofollow">personnel breakdown of the Ministry of Magic</a> provides a great many jobs, some of which
        probably have counterparts in Magical Britain's private sector: Dogsbodies are administrative assistants.
        Welcome witches are secretaries. Charm-masons, curse-weavers, and jinx-layers lay, maintain, and update
        enchantments of various kinds.</p>

            rel="nofollow">Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy</a>,” by ForestUUID, mention is made of the “rod
        squads” or “Sensitive Wand Acquisition Teams,” which are like a bomb disposal unit, “only magic, and with a
        psychologist on board.” Touching a wand that isn't yours can be dangerous, especially if its owner was
        dangerous. The Ministry doesn't always want to just destroy a dangerous wand, though, because wands have
        personalities and memories and you can learn a lot about a person from their wand. There is also a reference to
        “hexicographers,” who presumably compile spellbooks analogously to lexicographers.</p>

            Deathly Regiment</a>,” by Inverarity, we're told about Historicists, who sometimes use Time-turners in order
        to personally observe the past, although the exact method is a little complicated and involves other practices
        that are left mostly undescribed.</p>

    <p>In “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936" rel="nofollow">Birds of a
            Feather</a>,” by babylonsheep, a young Tom Riddle describes the respectability of different careers in the
        1930s:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>"The top tier of jobs after completing Hogwarts includes any position in the Ministry of Magic, St. Mungo's,
            or joining professional Quidditch. The first-string team is best, but no one will look down on a player
            fresh out of school making the reserves," said Tom. He held up a hand as Hermione's mouth opened to argue;
            neither of them thought very much of the most popular wizarding sporting pastime, and to consider it top
            tier was, to them, sheer absurdity. "These are what the Hogwarts authorities, or Professor Slughorn at
            least—and most people count him a good judge of these things—consider good, well-paying occupations for
            school leavers. And it's," he added, as if the words left a bad taste in his mouth, "socially respectable."
        </p>

        <p>"The middle tier," Tom continued, "is shop work. Manning a counter in Diagon Alley, clerking in the back, or
            filling orders at an apothecary or haberdashery. It wouldn't be so bad if the shop work came with an
            apprenticeship with one of the better proprietors, but how often does someone like Ollivander offer one to
            those outside his immediate family? The positions at Gringotts Bank are also considered second tier even
            though I hear the pay is on a level or higher than what the Ministry's offering, but everyone knows that the
            place is run by goblins, and that's nowhere near as respectable as working for proper wizards and witches.
        </p>

        <p>"The last and least tier—and I must profess I agree with Slughorn on this count—is magical menial labour,"
            said Tom with a sniff of disdain. "Farming and harvesting potions ingredients, dissecting salamanders and
            lionfish for parts, or breeding and raising magical creatures. Half of it's work you can't even use a wand
            for, because of the ridiculous special requirements like 'cut by a silver knife by the light of a sickle
            moon', or 'plucked in a maiden's palm on the first day of spring'. Nevertheless, it's work even the meanest
            halfwit can do, with or without a single N.E.W.T."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Werewolf Studies</h2>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re wondering what jobs a werewolf can hold down, there are two things worth keeping in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you get down to brass tacks, lycanthropy is a chronic illness that completely incapacitates a person
            for a couple of times a month and may leave them more or less wiped for several days beyond that. In other
            words, you can model Remus Lupin as somebody with a mild case of lupus.</li>
        <li>Werewolves with at least one Muggle parent, like Remus Lupin, will have an easier time getting Muggle
            documentation. They may not have an academic record if they grew up in magical Britain, but at least
            they&rsquo;ll have the paperwork to prove that they exist at all. Other werewolves who want to try their
            hand at working in the Muggle world, however, will face much the same circumstances as undocumented
            immigrants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tutors have the freedom to set eccentric schedules, but most werewolves won&rsquo;t have a complete Hogwarts
        education, much less a Muggle education. If Lupin earned an Astronomy N.E.W.T., however, then he could probably
        set his own rates: a maths tutor will always be in high demand, and even premodern astronomy requires geometry
        and trigonometry. Fluency in Latin is another skill with cross-world appeal, and somebody as well-read as Lupin
        might also get by as an English tutor. Remote work of any kind is often a godsend for the chronically ill, but
        there isn&rsquo;t much space for that in the 1990s. Freelance jobs like bookkeeping, editing, photography, and
        writing would fit this niche, however.</p>
    <p>Undocumented immigrants in the United Kingdom most often work in construction, food preparation (e.g. bar and
        kitchen staff), hospitality (e.g. housecleaning), manufacturing (e.g. factory work), personal care (e.g.
        childcare, hairstyling, nursing), transport and storage (e.g. warehouse work). They are likelier than other
        people to work night shifts and jobs with short contracts and/or uncertain hours.</p>
    <p>In any event, it&rsquo;s also possible to set up as a &ldquo;sole trader,&rdquo; or self-employed businessperson,
        though an undocumented wix will need to deal solely in cash. If they&rsquo;re discreet and their business looks
        small, however, then they&rsquo;re unlikely to attract serious attention. Criminal activity is also an option
        for the right kind of werewolf, though it&rsquo;s probably the case that the Ministry of Magic will come down on
        anyone who rely too much on magic to get by in the Muggle world, regardless of whether the activity is otherwise
        legal. Even if an ordinary wix could get away with cleaning Muggle houses with a Scouring Charm, the Ministry
        probably won&rsquo;t give any benefit of the doubt to a werewolf. Honestly, working in the Muggle world at all
        might not be allowed, on the grounds that werewolves are inherently a risk to the Statute of Secrecy or some
        shit like that.</p>
    <p>Other jobs which I have seen a Remus Lupin hold down: actor (generally in a background role) or stagehand,
        bartender, and private detective. </span></p>
