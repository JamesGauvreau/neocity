    <p>My own thinking, just to get it out of the way, is that the magical
        economy is radically different from the muggle economy:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p dir="ltr">1.1 Transfigurations are generally permanent, so the supply
            of materially-finished goods is limited to the ability of an individual
            wix to transfigure those goods.</p>

        <p>1.2 Even assuming that personal talent (both creative and magical)
            determines the quality of a set of transfigured robes, this still means
            that “magical manufacturing” is very different to muggle
            manufacturing.</p>

        <p>1.3 Anti-Theft Charms exist in canon, and we can easily suppose the
            existence of other enchantments, perhaps to prevent staining, extend
            use-life, and so forth. All, or almost all, goods in the magical world
            are enchanted in this way.</p>

        <p>1.4 Magic (and magical properties) cannot be created through
            transfiguration, so you cannot transfigure a stone into a unicorn
            tail.</p>

        <p>1.5 Therefore, when you buy an item in Diagon Alley, you are paying
            for (1) the creative and magical craftsmanship required to produce the
            item, (2) the cost of any magical components which might exist, and (3)
            any enchantments which were laid upon the item.</p>

        <p>2.1 If transfigurations are not permanent (which is the case in many
            fanfics), then the shape of the economy is still distorted by the way
            that wixes can enchant objects to move on their own, permitting a degree
            of automation whose only bottlenecks are (1) the number of tools which a
            wix can animate at a given time and (2) the rate at which a
            near-finished item can be enchanted and thereby completed.</p>

        <p>2.2 Despite the impossibility of transfiguring non-food into food,
            the ability to animate even a single tool at one time would have a
            dramatic effect on farming. Imagine, for example, being able to plow a
            field without relying on animal power, or enchanting a bag of seeds to
            float over a feed and scatter its contents across the furrows.</p>

    <p>The symbol ʛ is canonically used to refer to galleons. There are symbols
        for sickles and knuts as well, but they don't exist in unicode. ⨎ (or ʢ) and
        ⁂ (or ∴ or ⸫) are sorta close to the canonical symbols, though. For reasons
        unknown to me, wemyss used Γ., ſ., and ĸ. for galleons, sickles, and
        knuts.</p>

    <p>One downside to bimetallic currencies is that people can profit from
        exploiting the difference between the exchange rate of the two currencies
        and the actual availability of the substances which are converted into those
        currencies. If we allow for a strong distinction between plain gold and gold
        <em> galleons</em>, however, then solving this problem is straightforward,
        however: goblins make galleons (and sickles and knuts); goblin magic can
        distinguish between goblin-made galleons and galleons of another provenance;
        and goblins make galleons, sickles, and knuts in amounts that are
        proportionate to the exchange rate.
    </p>

    <p>“<a href="https://wemyss.livejournal.com/182444.html" rel="nofollow">Gnomes are from Zurich, Goblins are from
            Vienna</a>,” by
        wemyss, presents a common view of Gringotts and the economy: the bank has a
        full reserve, engages only moderately in loan services if it engages at all,
        charges for security vaults, takes a cut of the money that it mints, and
        perhaps makes a profit from other activities.</p>

    <p>The second chapter of “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13646271/chapters/64343005#workskin"
            rel="nofollow">What's in a Name: Headcanons and Geekery</a>,” by
        LadyAramisGrey, discusses the galleons-to-pounds exchange rate, possibly
        goblin uses for muggle currency, (the relative lack of) inflation, and
        prices, prices, more prices, and wages. It suggests the nonexistence of a
        property tax but possibly taxes for inheriting property or converting muggle
        property to magical property, and that apothecaries might also stock spices
        and ingredients for cooking meals as well as for brewing potions. There's
        also some interesting discussion about the Weasleys and Dobby, with respect
        to wages and cost of living.</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>Overall, the cost of monthly living for a wizard or witch who owns
            property but potentially doesn't have a comprehensive garden or
            livestock would appear to be around 80ʛ 8ʢ 8⸫ (food + basic clothing/2
            outfits and cloak + transport/2 daily trips + entertainment). Double it
            for a spouse. Add another 45 monthly galleons for food and clothing with
            each child and an extra hundred galleons for every child sent to
            Hogwarts. [...]
        </p>

        <p>Minimum wage to survive on our calculated monthly cost of living
            could be as low as 50ʛ per month (12-13ʛ/week) but the ideal average
            would be around 20ʛ/week. Naturally if you don't own property and are
            renting in the London Wizarding District, you would probably prefer a
            higher wage. [...]</p>

        <p>Using this as a model, I would say one galleon is equivalent to about
            £10 to £12 or about $16 to $20 USD in 2020 money based on equivalent
            items in the US and the UK. This would make a sickle (1ʢ), which is
            0.05882 of a galleon, equivalent to about £0.65 or $1.06, and a knut
            (1⸫), which is 0.002028 of a galleon would be somewhere in the range of
            £0.02 or $0.04 USD.</p>

        currency exchange rates for various cultures from 3,000 BC to the modern
        era, with suggestions for exchange rates in fantasy RPGs. If you want to do
        something special with the Wizarding economy, it may be worth a read.</p>

            rel="nofollow">Wizarding Money and Exchange Rate</a>,” by Owl Post, converts
        Magical British prices into USD and GBP, both at the value at that time and
        a later, inflation-adjusted value in 2017, and uses two exchange rates:
        Rowling's canonical exchange rate and a common canonical exchange rate.</p>
    <p>Before decimalization, the United Kingdom had pence (or penny, singular),
        shillings, and pounds. A quick and dirty way to convert prices would be to
        check the price of a given item in whatever time you prefer and convert it
        1:1 to knuts, sickles, and galleons. Make sure that you don't forget how
        (your version of) magic may affect prices, though: if nourishing food can't
        be transfigured, but chairs can, then a nice dinner may be more expensive
        than a chair made from some exotic wood.</p>

    <a name="PriceTransfig" rel="nofollow" id="PriceTransfig"></a><h1>The Price of Transfiguration <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <p>Muggles pay for a number of things when they purchase something: the raw
        material, the effort and expertise required to obtain that material and
        transform it into the end product, and other bullshit like advertising. From
        this perspective, it's arguable that the magical economy is (contrary to
        what I've said earlier) actually not all that different from the muggle
        economy.</p>

    <p>Transfiguration doesn't seem to be strongly limited by the relative sizes
        of the target object and what you intend to transform it into, but most
        “thing-to-thing” transfigurations involve objects of approximately similar
        size and it does appear that transfiguration of larger objects is harder
        than the transfiguration of smaller objects. I think it's reasonable to
        conclude that increasing the mass of an object through transfiguration,
        while not impossible, is more difficult than a transfiguration which
        involves no change in mass. On the same principle (“What can we reasonably
        infer, even if it wasn't spelled out and Rowling possibly didn't mean to
        imply it?”), it is easier to perform transfigurations between objects that
        are more similar to each other.</p>

    <p>In fact, we could use similarity as a general underlying principle: two
        objects of the same size are similar in mass (or spatial dimensions,
        depending on how you'd like to define size), and objects may also be similar
        in terms of both being organisms, or felines, or housecats (this seems
        strongly implied but I don't remember whether it was made explicit in the
        books). The greater the number of points of similarity, and the greater the
        degree of similarity in each case, the simpler the transfiguration, with the
        simplest possible operation being a transfiguration of an object into
        itself. The upshot is that most materials will be transfigured from a
        simpler substance, but wixes won't just transfigure everything from dirt (or
        even the air).</p>

    <p>Let's introduce another principle: it is easier to duplicate an object
        than to create a new one. Canonically, duplicates produced from the Doubling
        Charm are imperfect, and decay more quickly even if they are not immediately
        distinguishable from the original. You can choose to take this and run with
        it, but if you want to allow for physically perfect duplicates then there's
        another option, courtesy of “<a
            href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8484470/1/Potter-Who-and-the-Wossname-s-Thingummy" rel="nofollow">Potter
            Who and the Wossname's Thingummy</a>,” by
        ForrestUUID:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>“Those coins of yours. My dad finally got the Wixell tests back. If
            you want to sell them, he'll buy them. The Fugio cent has a duplicate
            somewhere, which cuts its value except to the owner of the other. The
            dime is unique.”</p>

        <p>“What are Wixell tests?”</p>

        <p>“Nodality — that's a transfigurational copy check — grade enhancement
            illusion and…well, no offense, you found them, if you can't trust Harry
            Potter who <em> can </em> you trust, but he had to verify they weren't
            stolen by somebody else.”</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>It should also be noted that conjuring or transfiguring “magic” appears
        to be impossible, which is to say that you can only obtain the exact effect
        of a particular spell by <em> casting </em> that spell. This is why, despite
        the difficulty of hunting Demiguises, high-quality Invisibility Cloaks are
        produced from actual Demiguises rather than by transfiguring other objects
        into Demiguise hides. This being so, it's probably also the case that
        specific animals will be raised for parchment (and other things) in order to
        exploit magical qualities that are easier to obtain by this process than by
        laying enchantments.</p>

    <p>Wixell Tests work pretty well for my personal canon, which permits (at
        least in theory) the perfect duplication of anything, even food (as Hermione
        explains in DH, you can increase the quantity of food if you've got some)
        and “quantity” is just another characteristic of an object, like color or
        mass, that can be altered through transfiguration. Because an object whose
        quantity has been altered is still one object (just with multiple physical
        instances), they still have a metaphysical connection that a Wixell Test
        could take advantage of.</p>

    <p>Thrifty wixes probably won't care whether their coat is a duplicate, but
        you can be sure that the Malfoys have a Certificate of Uniqueness
        (Certificate Sui Generis?) for every last item in their possession, and even
        if you don't go that far, it's probably a low-class sort of thing to
        intentionally purchase duplicated goods (The price difference probably isn't
        as much as you imagine. If it's impossible to produce a magical property
        simply through transfiguration or duplication then each duplicated item will
        have to be enchanted just the same as the original, so you're only saving on
        the physical craftsmanship of the piece).</p>
    <h2>Wizarding Fashion</h2>

        <li>Anti-Theft charms to prevent anybody but the proper owner (and
            perhaps others, if allowed) from Summoning the clothing.</li>
        <li>Charms to keep away soot and grime, and to prevent staining.</li>
        <li>Charm to keep ashes and Floo powder off.</li>
        <li>Colorfast and Lightfast charms to prevent the dyes from running or
            fading, respectively.</li>

    <h2>Historical Occupations</h2>
    <p><strike>Ireland</strike>
    <p><b>Colorators applied color</b> , especially to textiles or
        black-and-white photographs (these are separate occupations with similar
        objectives and the same name). Other names include <em> dexter </em>
        (textiles), <em>
            faker </em> (photographs), and <em> tinter </em> (either). The
        <b>dyes might be prepared</b> by a color-witch or color-wizard.
    </p>

    <p><b>Fly coaches </b> were hired by the hour, and <b>glass coaches </b>by
        the day. I like the idea of generalizing this to e.g. glass-wizards are
        laborers who are hired and paid by the day, and might be called
        glass-dockers, etc., according to their line of work.</p>

    <p><b>Lamp exhausters </b>drained the air from lightbulbs, back when that
        was a thing that had to be done. Perhaps the magical sort interfere with
        Muggle devices.</p>

    <p>In Muggle history, <b>owlers</b> smuggled wool or sheep between England
        and France, but magical owlers should probably smuggle owls. Other smugglers
        were called smugsmiths.</p>

    <p>People who <b>sold goods door-to-door or on the street</b> (usually from
        carts or stalls) were called hawkers, higglers (perhaps from “haggle”),
        hucksters (or huxters), and peddlers. Hucksters got their modern poor
        reputation because they were known to sell cheap, even shoddy goods. Sellers
        of produce were also called costermongers and greengrocers,</p>

    <p>The term “hawker” and the suffix “-monger” were used broadly for
        <b>sellers of certain goods</b>, i.e. fish was sold by fish hawkers and
        fishmongers. Presumably, a seller of hawks was a hawk hawker. The -monger
        suffix often has a negative connotation: we talk of rumormongers and
        whoremongers today, but not of truthmongers, and we do talk of
        “peacemongers,” but usually not in a complimentary way. The place where the
        -monger sells their goods is a -mongery, i.e. fishmongery, ironmongery.
        “Lightmongers” installed rather than sold lighting.
    </p>

    <p>In the period leading up to the Statute of Secrecy, the Catholic Church
        was remarkably lenient toward prostitutes &ndash; Augustine, Aquinas, and
        other Church Fathers did not exactly <i>approve</i> of sex work, but they
        tolerated it, and in some parts of England the bishops and other church
        authorities expressly supported it. The Tudor monarchs (r. late 15th and
        16th centuries) were notably stricter, but following the restoration of the
        English monarchy in 1660 laxness was again the order of the day. If we
        follow the model of Medieval and premodern England, it would be plausible to
        see regular inspections, limitations on where prostitutes can work and how
        they can dress, worker protections (including a limit on how much a brothel
        could charge its prostitutes for their rooms).</p>
    <h2>Magical Occupations</h2>
    <p>First of all, we know that there are people in the service industry, such
        as bartenders, servers, and waiters; store staff, such as cashiers and
        saleswixes; and there are people involved in communication and journalism,
        like broadcasters, columnists, and photographers. There are enough actors
        for a Wizarding Academy of Dramatic Arts, and there are comedians, dancers,
        musicians, and other entertainers, as well as special effects wixes who work
        in the theater.</p>

    <p>There are also people involved in the making and selling of brooms, who
        we might call (in old-fashioned terms) broom squires and broom dashers,
        respectively. There are farmers, who grow plants for potion-supplies, as
        well as trees for broomsticks and wands. There are tutors for magical
        children not yet old enough to go to Hogwarts, and there may be tutors for
        that subset of children who never go to Hogwarts. There are Healers; and
        there are mediwitches or mediwizards, who may be the same thing, or a subset
        specializing in traumatic injuries or first response.</p>

    <p>Magenta Cornstock was an “experimental artist,” and this probably just
        means “artist who did weird stuff,” but there are talking portraits and
        moving photographs, so perhaps it could also involve actual research and
        experimentation. In any case, there are other researchers as well:
        Aurologists (who, in the film canon, study auras), Dragonologists, and
        Herbologists among them.</p>

    <p>The terms “mechanic” and “technician” feel awfully Muggle, but they point
        to occupations that would have a presence in Magical Britain and I think it
        would be useful to have a general term for somebody that maintains and
        repairs objects of a magical nature. Right now I like <em> mystician</em>,
        which sounds like “magician” and implies an initiation into secret lore (the
        sacred mysteries of installing and repairing magical HVAC systems).
    </p>

    <p>The OE defines <em> arcanist </em> as "a person who has knowledge of a
        secret process of manufacture.” The Old English “hellruna” referred to a
        person who performed necromancy, speaking with the dead for the purpose of
        divination; today, the term would be <em> hellrune</em>.</p>

    <p>There's certainly a need for magical pest exterminators.</p>

    <p>British wizards like their watches and clocks, so there are probably
        people who specialize in making clocks and watchers (I like the term
        “horologer”).</p>

    <p>On Reddit, there have been many interesting suggestions:

        noted that Muggles could be the focus of professions besides
        Obliviators, the Muggle-worthy Excuses Committee, and other employees of
        the Ministry, such as <i>surveyors</i>, who check and alter Muggle
        records to make sure that eyebrows won't be raised when you magically
        conceal an entire townhouse (cough Grimmauld Place cough); and
        <i>distancers</i>, who keep the Muggles out of your hair, whether the
        neighbor kids are being rude to your children or a company wants to
        build its next factory in your backyard.

        Artist Formerly Known as
        Taure, there are several magical platforms at King's Cross: Platform 7 ½ (to
        Constantinople, in 1991), Platform 8 ½ (to Hogwarts, in 1992), and Platform
        9 ¾ (to Hogwarts, in 1991; to Tromsø, in 1992). I like this, because trains
        are great and there should be more of them. It also provides another method
        of international travel and gives Platform 9 ¾ something more to do when the
        Hogwarts Express isn't running.</p>

            rel="nofollow">personnel breakdown of the Ministry of Magic</a> provides a
        great many jobs, some of which probably have counterparts in Magical
        Britain's private sector: Dogsbodies are administrative assistants. Welcome

        maintain, and update enchantments of various kinds.</p>

            rel="nofollow">Potter Who and the Wossname's Thingummy</a>,” by ForestUUID,
        mention is made of the “rod squads” or “Sensitive Wand Acquisition Teams,”
        which are like a bomb disposal unit, “only magic, and with a psychologist on
        board.” Touching a wand that isn't yours can be dangerous, especially if its
        owner was dangerous. The Ministry doesn't always want to just destroy a
        dangerous wand, though, because wands have personalities and memories and
        you can learn a lot about a person from their wand. There is also a
        reference to “hexicographers,” who presumably compile spellbooks analogously
        to lexicographers.</p>

            Deathly Regiment</a>,” by Inverarity,
        we're told about Historicists, who sometimes use Time-turners in order to
        personally observe the past, although the exact method is a little
        complicated and involves other practices that are left mostly
        undescribed.</p>

    <p>In “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/15996890/chapters/37322936" rel="nofollow">Birds of a
            Feather</a>,” by babylonsheep, a young Tom Riddle
        describes the respectability of different careers in the 1930s:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>"The top tier of jobs after completing Hogwarts includes any position
            in the Ministry of Magic, St. Mungo's, or joining professional
            Quidditch. The first-string team is best, but no one will look down on a
            player fresh out of school making the reserves," said Tom. He held up a
            hand as Hermione's mouth opened to argue; neither of them thought very
            much of the most popular wizarding sporting pastime, and to consider it
            top tier was, to them, sheer absurdity. "These are what the Hogwarts
            authorities, or Professor Slughorn at least—and most people count him a
            good judge of these things—consider good, well-paying occupations for
            school leavers. And it's," he added, as if the words left a bad taste in
            his mouth, "socially respectable."
        </p>

        <p>"The middle tier," Tom continued, "is shop work. Manning a counter in
            Diagon Alley, clerking in the back, or filling orders at an apothecary
            or haberdashery. It wouldn't be so bad if the shop work came with an
            apprenticeship with one of the better proprietors, but how often does
            someone like Ollivander offer one to those outside his immediate family?
            The positions at Gringotts Bank are also considered second tier even
            though I hear the pay is on a level or higher than what the Ministry's
            offering, but everyone knows that the place is run by goblins, and
            that's nowhere near as respectable as working for proper wizards and
            witches.
        </p>

        <p>"The last and least tier—and I must profess I agree with Slughorn on
            this count—is magical menial labour," said Tom with a sniff of disdain.
            "Farming and harvesting potions ingredients, dissecting salamanders and
            lionfish for parts, or breeding and raising magical creatures. Half of
            it's work you can't even use a wand for, because of the ridiculous
            special requirements like 'cut by a silver knife by the light of a
            sickle moon', or 'plucked in a maiden's palm on the first day of
            spring'. Nevertheless, it's work even the meanest halfwit can do, with
            or without a single N.E.W.T."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>Werewolf Studies</h2>
    <p>If you&rsquo;re wondering what jobs a werewolf can hold down, there are
        two things worth keeping in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you get down to brass tacks, lycanthropy is a chronic illness
            that completely incapacitates a person for a couple of times a month and
            may leave them more or less wiped for several days beyond that. In other
            words, you can model Remus Lupin as somebody with a mild case of
            lupus.</li>
        <li>Werewolves with at least one Muggle parent, like Remus Lupin, will
            have an easier time getting Muggle documentation. They may not have an
            academic record if they grew up in magical Britain, but at least
            they&rsquo;ll have the paperwork to prove that they exist at all. Other
            werewolves who want to try their hand at working in the Muggle world,
            however, will face much the same circumstances as undocumented
            immigrants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tutors have the freedom to set eccentric schedules, but most werewolves
        won&rsquo;t have a complete Hogwarts education, much less a Muggle
        education. If Lupin earned an Astronomy N.E.W.T., however, then he could
        probably set his own rates: a maths tutor will always be in high demand, and
        even premodern astronomy requires geometry and trigonometry. Fluency in
        Latin is another skill with cross-world appeal, and somebody as well-read as
        Lupin might also get by as an English tutor. Remote work of any kind is
        often a godsend for the chronically ill, but there isn&rsquo;t much space
        for that in the 1990s. Freelance jobs like bookkeeping, editing,
        photography, and writing would fit this niche, however.</p>
    <p>Undocumented immigrants in the United Kingdom most often work in
        construction, food preparation (e.g. bar and kitchen staff), hospitality
        (e.g. housecleaning), manufacturing (e.g. factory work), personal care (e.g.
        childcare, hairstyling, nursing), transport and storage (e.g. warehouse
        work). They are likelier than other people to work night shifts and jobs
        with short contracts and/or uncertain hours.</p>
    <p>In any event, it&rsquo;s also possible to set up as a &ldquo;sole
        trader,&rdquo; or self-employed businessperson, though an undocumented wix
        will need to deal solely in cash. If they&rsquo;re discreet and their
        business looks small, however, then they&rsquo;re unlikely to attract
        serious attention. Criminal activity is also an option for the right kind of
        werewolf, though it&rsquo;s probably the case that the Ministry of Magic
        will come down on anyone who rely too much on magic to get by in the Muggle
        world, regardless of whether the activity is otherwise legal. Even if an
        ordinary wix could get away with cleaning Muggle houses with a Scouring
        Charm, the Ministry probably won&rsquo;t give any benefit of the doubt to a
        werewolf. Honestly, working in the Muggle world at all might not be allowed,
        on the grounds that werewolves are inherently a risk to the Statute of
        Secrecy or some shit like that.</p>
    <p>Other jobs which I have seen a Remus Lupin hold down: actor (generally in
        a background role) or stagehand, bartender, and private detective.

    <a name="Taxation" rel="nofollow" id="Taxation"></a><h1>Taxation <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <p>"Tax farming" was an ancient practice by which the government (for a
        given value of "government") sold off the right to collect taxes. The buyer,
        called a tax farmer, then employed what means they might in order to extract
        that tax, hoping to profit by getting more in taxes than they'd paid. The
        seller may earn less tax revenue but is saved the trouble of extracting that
        revenue. Tax farming is uncommon today, but was still practiced in England
        as late as 1684 (if not later).</p>
    <p>People in &thorn;e olden times hated income taxes just as much as
        right-libertarians do today. Maybe more. It's plausible that the Ministry of
        Magic may not directly levy an income tax, although they, like historical
        governments, may find indirect methods (like the window tax, described
        below). There were also privacy concerns about taxes that required somebody
        to get up in your (figurative or literal) business: tax collectors might
        have to enter your house to properly levy the hearth tax, but could check
        windows from the outside. </p>
    <p>The <b>hearth tax</b> (or chimney tax) was levied on households as a
        proxy for population, since it's a lot harder to hide fireplaces than spare
        family members. The Ministry would have an additional mode of verification
        by checking Floo Network records, and indeed Floo connections may explicitly
        be what they count nowadays. The tax was paid twice yearly, on Michaelmas
        (29th of September) and Lady Day (25th of March). People hated it and tried
        all kinds of shenanigans to hide their hearths. In England and Ireland, the
        hearth tax in the 1680s was two shillings: perhaps the Ministry levies a tax
        of two sickles.</p>
    <p>The <b>window tax</b> was a proto-income tax that levied two shillings
        per house, and an additional four shillings for those whose house had
        between ten and twenty windows, or an additional eight shillings if the
        house had more than twenty windows. Later, and post-Statute, the window tax
        would vary according to property value</p>
    <p>The modern television licence fee was preceded by a <b>wireless
            licence</b>, which, like the television licence, was intended to fund the
        BBC. It originally cost ten shillings per year. Like watching TV without a
        licence today, it was illegal to listen to radio broadcasts without a
        wireless licence.</p>
    <p>18th century taxes (postdating the Statute but perhaps still useful for
        inspiration) include the <b>brick tax</b>, levied per thousand bricks but
        then, because brick manufacturers increased the size of their bricks,
        according to the dimensions of the brick; the <b>clocks and watches tax</b>,
        which nearly ruined those industries and was repealed within the year; the
        <b>glass tax</b>, initially levied by weight on the materials used to make
        glass, which encouraged the creation of smaller, more intricate, and hollow
        objects, and was regarded as a tax on light (because windows could provide
        light without fuel); the <b>hat tax</b>, paid upon the purchase of a hat and
        levied with the idea that the rich would own more hats than the poor; and
        the <b>wallpaper tax</b>, levied on patterned, printed, or painted
        wallpaper, in response to which people purchased blank wallpaper and had it
        stenciled later.
    <p><b>Murage</b>, <b>pavage</b>, and <b>pontage</b> refer to taxes or other
        fees levied for the construction and maintenance of town walls, paved roads,
        and bridges respectively. In many cases they would only last for a few
        months or years, until the next time that money was needed. <b>Poundage</b>
        was a tariff of (originally) one shilling per pound-weight of all
        merchandise either imported to or exported from England, for the sake of
        maintaining a strong navy; and tonnage was a similar tariff, applied per tun
        (or ton) of wine imported to England. The national <b>land tax</b> was introduced in 1692</p>
    <p><b>Playing cards</b> were taxed from the 16th century through to the 20th. Out of each deck for which the fee was
        paid, one card might be stamped, printed with a special design, or differentiated in another way. Forging this
        differentiation was punishable by death. </p>
    <p>Though it isn't a British or Irish institution, the Dutch <b>water
            boards</b> are worth mentioning. These institutions were charged with
        managing dams, dikes, and other infrastructure that kept the country
        unflooded, and can require particular people to work on particular projects
        (e.g. requiring people to work to maintain the part of a dike that is
        closest to them), levy taxes, and punish offenders – penalties might include
        branding and even execution. The water boards are local institutions but coordinate with each other through the
        High Water Authority.</p>
    <h2>Wizarding Taxes</h2>
    <p>In “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/14367483/chapters/33167958" rel="nofollow">Lady Archimedes</a>,”
        by White Squirrel, there is a
        <b>tax on extra wands</b>. In other stories by the same author (mostly
        “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/14078862/chapters/32436069">The
            Accidental Animagus,</a>” but also mentioned in “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/14281440/chapters/32942874">The
            Arithmancer</a>”), there is an Elf Transfer Tariff, which is levied
        whenever a House-elf is sold from one family to another, and is
        sufficiently expensive that a poor family might not be able to pay the
        tariff even if they got the elf for a very low price (which is exactly
        the point of the tariff: keeping elves out of the hands of the poors).
    </p>
    <p>The Ministry of Magic almost certainly requires people to pay for a
        wireless licence. I would bet my (blessedly untaxed) hat on it. A hearth
        tax, Floo tax, or something of that nature, is also plausible. </p>

    <p>The historical tax on playing cards might be reflected in a tax on decks of tarot cards. </p>
    <p>If there are communal Wizardspaces or other places that require some kind
    of ongoing maintenance (e.g. Diagon Alley, whether it's located in a pocket
    dimension or twisted space, or just hidden from the Muggles), then there
    might be authorities like the water board – a Wizardspace Board, say – that
    are authorized by the Ministry (or merely by long precedent) to maintain
    these spaces. </p>
    <p>If you feel the need to justify how a Dutch institution
    influenced British and Irish wixes, there are two main routes: (1) via John
    of Gaunt, who, I have argued, might be related to the Gaunts, and whose
    native Flanders also had water boards; and (2) via the Strangers, 16th
    century Dutch Protestant immigrants to Norwich, England, whose ranks may
    plausibly have included the Bagmans, Boots, Clearwaters, Crabbes, Cranes,
    Derricks, Gamps, Maxes, Sprouts, and/or Zellers, all of whom bear names that
    may be (or probably are) Dutch in origin.</p>
    <a name="Sports" rel="nofollow" id="Sports"></a><h1>A Matter of Sport <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h1>
    <p>If we assume that there are 20,000 wixes in Britain and that only
        professional Quidditch players qualify as “professional athletes,” then
        there are 91-182 professional Quidditch players in the British and Irish
        Quidditch League (thirteen teams, each with seven players and an unknown
        number of reservists, who may or may not be merely semiprofessional). For
        comparison, there were roughly 12,600 professional athletes in the United
        Kingdom in 2010, or 0.46% vs 0.02% of their respective populations.</p>

    <p>In other words, the relative proportion of professional athletes in
        Magical Britain is twenty-three times greater than in the United Kingdom,
        and we can assume that the difference is that much greater if we count other
        kinds of athletes besides Quidditch players. There are two non-mutually
        exclusive explanations for the imbalance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The economic situations of Magical Britain and the United Kingdom
            are sufficiently different to permit a much larger population of
            professional athletes, comprising perhaps as much as 1% of the overall
            population (and 2-3% of the working population).</li>
        <li>“Professional” Quidditch players (and/or other athletes) are
            better-described as “semi-professional” in muggle terms: they have side
            jobs or some other source of income. If there's a great gulf of support
            between Quidditch and other sports then it may be that Quidditch players
            are truly professional but most reservists and other athletes are
            semi-professional or even amateur.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In either case, if you really want to dig into this side of Magical
        Britain, then it may be worth looking at professional players of
        less-popular games, like chess, fencing, and Scrabble, where overall incomes
        are lower and often depend on winning competitions (the worst professional
        football team to compete in the World Cup still gets paid, but the
        fourth-best fencer to compete in the World Championship gets nada). It's not
        uncommon for these players to reside in places with a low cost of living or
        even to be fully itinerant as they travel from one competition to another.
        Chess players can also make money from appearance fees, sponsorships,
        writing, coaching, working in related organizations, and acquiring
        scholarships and stipends, most of which are also options for Quidditch
        players.</p>

    <p>I don't spend much time on this aspect of dueling, but in my series “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368" rel="nofollow">There is
            Nothing to Fear</a>,” professional duelists expect to compete at least
        throughout Europe, and when Tom Riddle embarks on a Grand Tour of the world
        following his graduation from Hogwarts, his itinerary is influenced by the
        dueling circuit, a pretty well-worn set of dueling competitions whose
        location and timing take into account the need to give duelists from one
        competition enough time to travel to the next. There are regional and global
        circuits, and the regional circuits aren't in sync with each other, but
        they're all synced with the global circuit.</p>

    <p>Amid all this talk of sport teams and demographics, it is worth noting
        that Liechtenstein has seven professional football teams, despite a
        population just shy of 40,000 (though it is also worth noting that these
        teams regularly play in neighboring Switzerland).</p>
