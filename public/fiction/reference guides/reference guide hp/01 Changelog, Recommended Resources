    <h3>Potter Canon <a href="#Contents" rel="nofollow">▲</a></h3>

    <p>First, what’s canon? Practically every reader takes the seven Harry Potter-titled books, PS to DH, as canon. Most
        will also take the books <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them </em>and <em>Quidditch Through the
            Ages</em> as canon. Plenty of people use the films and even the video games to supplement this, but if your
        fic gives priority to the films over the books then you’re best off mentioning this at the beginning so that
        nobody has the wrong expectations. A significant minority of writers and readers ignore the <em>Fantastic
            Beasts</em> movies, in whole or in part, and you shouldn’t feel weird about doing the same (though, again,
        it might be good to telegraph that fact in some way <em>before </em>it becomes a plot-crucial point).</p>

    <p>If I say that something is "canon" or "canonical," without specifying further, then I'm probably talking about
        "Book+" Canon: The seven main books plus <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> and <em>Quidditch</em>.  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>I figure that anyone who’s reading this already knows about the <a
                href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter Wiki</a>, but if you
            didn’t, now you do. Be warned that HPW is a mess, though. It insists on treating everything as canonical
            unless it specifically contradicts the books, which means that the Wiki’s vision of canon exists in a weird
            superposition where Death Eaters collapsed both the Brockdale Bridge and the Millennium Bridge, even though
            construction on the latter didn’t even begin until 1998: “Fudge refused to step down, and thus Voldemort
            ordered Death Eaters to cause the Brockdale Bridge and the Millennium Bridge to collapse.”</li>
        <li>Anyway, despite the Harry Potter Wiki’s penchant for treating LEGO Harry Potter as canonical, it is (like
            the real Wikipedia) still a decent starting point if you aren’t sure about something. In particular, its
            page on the <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/1991%E2%80%931992_school_year"
                rel="nofollow">1991-1992 school year</a> has a list of every canonical professor and student attending
            Hogwarts at that time, with students organized by year.</li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/" rel="nofollow">Harry Potter Lexicon</a> has much less information
            than HPW, but is far, far better sourced. I particularly like the <a
                href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/timeline/character-timelines/voldemort-timeline/"
                rel="nofollow">Timeline of events in the life of Voldemort | Tom Riddle, Jr.</a></li>
        <li>In "<a
                href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fiangw/article_a_crazily_comprehensive_canon_exploration/"
                rel="nofollow">Crazily Comprehensive Canon Exploration of Goblins</a>," Choice Caterpillar checks every
            canonical reference to goblins and gives a thorough analysis of what the books tell us about goblins. Backup
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220906011823/https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/fiangw/article_a_crazily_comprehensive_canon_exploration/"
                rel="nofollow">here</a>.</li>
        <li>White Hound’s "<a href="http://members.madasafish.com/~cj_whitehound/Fanfic/Sectumsempra.htm"
                rel="nofollow">Sectumsempra and the nature of curses</a>" makes an argument for the workings of
            Sectumsempra. Whether or not you agree, it’s probably good for a refresher on what canon does and doesn’t
            say about Sectumsempra and curses in general.</li>
        <li>White Hound wrote a comprehensive list of “<a
                href="http://members.madasafish.com/~cj_whitehound/Fanfic/birthdates.htm" rel="nofollow">Birthdates in
                the Harry Potter universe</a>.” Sorry, did I say “list?” I meant “essay.” 20,000 words.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.potter-search.com/" rel="nofollow">Potter Search</a> allows you to search the text of
            all seven books.</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.accio-quote.org/" rel="nofollow">Accio Quote</a> collects a trove of quotes and comments
            by J. K. Rowling.</li>

    <p>Because I find myself checking things like this fairly frequently, and consulting the Reference Guide is more
        convenient for me than dealing with the Fandom.com wiki, I'm stashing a couple of quick timelines here.</p>

                rel="nofollow">Ultimate Unofficial Guide to the Mysteries of Harry Potter</a>. The book is hopelessly
            obsolete as a canon resource, but the “mysteries,” and especially the chapter on “Book 5 and Beyond,” can
            help you to see the series (especially the first four books) with fresh eyes. Quirrell doesn’t really have a
            place in most fanfics, but the Guide points out that Quirrell was only “left to die” by Voldemort; there’s
            some interesting wiggle room there, if you want to seize it. Not all of this analysis is all that great,
            though. The Guide seems to think that most relevant thing about the myth of Romulus and Remus is that Remus
            was killed by his brother, and not, say, that Remus was raised by a wolf. </li>

        <strong>Names</strong>

    <ul>
        <li>For the meanings of given names, I recommend starting at <a href="http://www.behindthename.com/"
                rel="nofollow">Behind the Name</a>. </li>
        <li>For the meanings of surnames, I recommend starting at <a href="https://familysearch.org/en/surname"
                rel="nofollow">FamilySearch.org</a> and following it up with the <a href="https://www.surnamedb.com/"
                rel="nofollow">Internet Surname Database</a>, which usually gives more information about family history
            than FamilySearch. For distribution, the best site is generally <a href="https://en.geneanet.org/surnames/"
                rel="nofollow">Geneanet</a>, which allows you to refer only to records in a specific span of time from
            1500 to 2023, and occasionally has information that isn't available on FamilySearch. If you're having
            trouble identifying a region that shows up on Geneanet, then cross-referencing the name on <a
                href="https://www.ancestry.co.uk/learn/facts?geo_a=r&amp;geo_s=uk&amp;geo_t=uk&amp;geo_v=2.0.0&amp;o_iid=41012&amp;o_lid=41012&amp;o_sch=Web+Property"
                rel="nofollow">Ancestry</a> will often help. If all else fails, you might be able to find track down a
            family on <a href="https://www.wikitree.com/" rel="nofollow">WikiTree</a>, and <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a> is always a good last
            reference if you want to be really thorough. If you're lucky, you might even find additional resources to
            check. <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wiktionary</a> has also
            come in handy for me from time to time.</li>
        <li>For surnames related to places, <a href="https://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/gateway/"
                rel="nofollow">Heritage Gateway</a> and <a href="https://epns.nottingham.ac.uk/" rel="nofollow">Survey

        <li>Finally, don't discount Googling <samp>&lt;name_here&gt; "surname" </samp>and following whatever links look
            promising. </li>
