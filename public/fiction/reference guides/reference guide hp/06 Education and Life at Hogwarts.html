    <h3>Departments</h3>
    <h1>Student Life</h1>
    <h2>Student Population</h2>
    <p>There are a lot of students and not many professors, so it's worth considering how to handle this. Some
        possibilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If, (1) from first to fifth year, each house takes a particular class with another house, (2) in sixth
            and
            seventh year there is a single merged class that consists of all the students in that year, and (3) each
            student two hours of class-time class per week, then core class professors will spend twenty-four hours
            in
            the classroom per week. Even with homework and other duties, this is a fairly manageable courseload for
            the
            teachers. It would require students to have lots of out-of-class study time, but it's possible to fit
            these
            classes so into an 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. schedule with time for lunch (see LittleDinghy's “Harry Potter
            and
            the Hogwarts Class Schedules” post, mentioned below), so this seems doable to me.</li>
        <li>“<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/22022296/chapters/52554820" rel="nofollow">Blood Crest</a>,”
            by
            Cauchy, gives Time-Turners to the professors. One side benefit of this is that giving a Time-Turner to a
            studious fourteen-year-old sounds more reasonable if the staff are already using them.</li>
        <li>There are more teachers than we see in Rowling's canon (see the section below, “Departments,” for more
            about
            this).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>“<a href="https://www.hp-lexicon.org/2006/01/28/secrets-of-the-classlist/" rel="nofollow">Secrets of the
            Classlist</a>,” by Diana Summers, takes a quasi-canonical list of students in Harry's year (spotted in
        passing during the Christmas BBC special “Harry Potter and Me”) to argue that Muggle and Magical Britain are
        roughly demographically similar. The article tries to extrapolate this into more concrete information about
        various students (e.g. the surname Bones “predominates in Essex, so perhaps they live in Chelmsford”).</p>

    <p>Be aware, however, that Summers wades into some waters that are sketchy at best. As one of my beta readers
        commented to me, “I can't actually think of any other place I've seen Semite used as a noun,” and Summers
        chooses to describe the East End of London as “exactly where you would expect to find new migrants, ethnic
        minorities, and other groups of poor people.” While I think that the article is still worth reading, I can't
        say
        as much for her Classlist ebook, which doesn't really give any useful information (unless you were still
        wondering whether Summers is a Tory who thinks of foreigners primarily in terms of racial stereotypes).</p>

    <p><a href="http://members.madasafish.com/~cj_whitehound/Fanfic/fanonvscanon.htm#ethnicity" rel="nofollow">
            White
            Hound goes a bit further</a> (in demographics breakdowns, not weird racist stuff) and proposes that,
        during
        the time that Harry attends Hogwarts, there should be thirteen black students at Hogwarts, thirty-four other
        non-white students (mostly South Asian), and fifteen Muslim students. She also suggests that there are
        probably
        only a dozen queer students at the time, which I'd like to argue against for a moment:</p>

    <p>First, White Hound bases her numbers on self-identification, which depends on a person's willingness to give
        that
        information to somebody else. Even among Muggles, that “just under 2%” figure that she gives is probably
        lower
        than the actual rate. Second, Muggle culture isn't necessarily reflective of magical culture, and wixes may
        hold
        different forms of bigotry, to different degrees, and construct and enforce gender differently. A woman was
        Minister for Magic in 1798, for God's sake, so whatever else is going on, Dumbledore probably isn't telling
        witches to get back into the kitchen.</p>

    <p>Plus, fuck TERFs. Everybody at Hogwarts is trans.</p>

    <p>“<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/24571204" rel="nofollow">11 Wizarding Schools: A Look at the
            Logistics Behind JKRs Concept of Wizarding Education</a>,” by Eliza Grace, proposes that there are 910
        children eligible to attend Hogwarts in 1991, that 182 of these are Muggle-born, and in total 750 to 850
        children actually attended, with the rest homeschooled or sent to other schools.</p>

    <p><a name="back1" rel="nofollow" id="back1"></a>Eliza Grace is one of the few to address a relevant question:
        “How
        many Muggle-borns are at Hogwarts?” Only a handful of Muggle-borns in Harry's year appear in the books:
        Kevin
        Entwhistle, Justin Finch-Fletchley, and Hermione Granger. If we assume that (1) these represent all of the
        Muggle-borns in Harry's year and (2) there are forty students in Harry's year (both of which are arguable<a
            href="#note1" rel="nofollow"><sup>1</sup></a>), then only 7.5% of Harry's year is Muggle-born. J. K.
        Rowlings original classlist, as (partially) glimpsed on the Christmas special “Harry Potter and Me,” shows
        Hannah Abbot and “Trevor” Boot as Muggle-borns, as well as the three canonical Muggle-borns, so it <em>
            seems
        </em>that Rowling reduced the number of Muggle-borns in Harry's year (we can only make inferences about a
        few of
        the students in his year, so there might well be other Muggle-borns whose heritage just didn't come up), but
        the
        classlist doesn't even have the right names for everybody, so you can only use it with a grain of salt.</p>

    <p>But what if you want to argue for a different proportion of Muggle-borns without adding any students to
        Harry's
        year? Here are two ways that you can massage the numbers:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Many writers say that there were fewer students in Harry's year than you might expect, because fewer
            people
            were having children in the midst of the war with Voldemort. Muggles wouldn't be affected by this, so
            the
            proportion of Muggle-borns in Harry's year might be unusually high.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, we know that it's possible to identify Muggle-borns before they reach Hogwarts. The
            Book
            of Admittance records them at the moment that they first perform accidental magic, and there may be
            other
            ways to find a young Muggle-born. If you want more than a handful of Muggle-borns per (normal) year,
            then
            perhaps the Death Eaters located and murdered many of the Muggle-born children who otherwise would have
            attended in Harry's year, and Hermione, Justin, and Kevin represent the survivors.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You can combine these as well, and say that Harry's year is unusually small for both reasons: because wixes
        were
        having fewer children and because the Death Eaters murdered a metric fuckton of Muggle-born children.</p>
    <h2>But What Do They Teach?</h2>
    <p>There are some classes which we know little about, and some subjects which seem woefully untaught at
        Hogwarts.
        Here's my spin, which you can take or leave as you please:</p>
    <ul>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Arithmancy </b>is adjacent to divination, with a small overlap between them, but there's more to
                “the
                magical properties of numbers” than just figuring out the future: exponential numbers, the law of
                first
                digits, and the law of large numbers (to say nothing of the law of very large numbers). The subject
                includes accounting, combinatorics, probabilities, and statistics. Spell-crafting is a part of the
                curriculum as well, but almost incidentally, and it is not the only place where you can learn the
                art.
                Arithmancy is less about building new spells than about <em>testing</em> new spells, using a series
                of
                arithmantic formulae to predict (with varying levels of success) the outcome of your design or to
                better
                understand another person's spell. It's possible to work backwards and use arithmancy to assist the
                design process, but arithmancy won't carry you the whole way on its own.</li>
            <li><b>Astronomy </b>isn't just about stars and planets. It's also where wixes continue their education
                in
                mathematics, and includes algebra, calculus, geometry, and trigonometry, all of which were known to
                the
                ancients and are very useful to astronomers. Astronomical knowledge is relevant to Herbology and
                Potions
                (some plants and potions must be prepared under the influence of particular celestial phenomena) and
                was
                integral to the form of spellcasting that was common in Britain before the modern wand-based
                paradigm
                took hold.</li>
            <li><b>Study of Ancient Runes </b>is primarily a “dead languages” class with a focus on Old English and
                the
                “northern speech,” as well as the runic alphabets that they might be written in and the symbolic
                meanings of those runes. There's a lot of old poetry and magical texts that were authoritative in
                their
                time but are obsolete today. Students will also learn a little of Egyptian hieroglyphics, some Latin
                and
                Greek, and a bit of Hebrew: nowhere near enough to be considered fluent, but enough to navigate an
                appropriate dictionary. To the extent that they are used in enchantments, other classes will give
                some
                instruction on runes but there's a big difference between “this is what you do” and “this is why you
                do
                it.”</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Class Schedules and Lesson Plans</h2>
    <p>Several people have written curricula and schedules for Hogwarts. I don't use any of these exclusively, but
        they've all been useful, especially the editable class schedules sheet and the Hogwarts Curriculum
        Worldbuilding
        Resource.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>“<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/bkcp8q/harry_potter_and_the_class_curriculum/"
                rel="nofollow">Harry Potter and the Class Curriculum</a>,” by LittleDinghy, has basic topics for
            each of
            the three terms of the year, for each of the core classes and electives. For example, 5th Year Potions
            students study Poisons in their first term, Antidotes in their second, and Antidotes II in their third,
            during which time they also review for their O.W.L.s.</li>
        <li>“<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/b93g9f/harry_potter_and_the_hogwarts_class_schedules_a/"
                rel="nofollow">Harry Potter and the Hogwarts Class Schedules</a>,” also by LittleDinghy, organizes
            classes across three morning periods and another three evening periods. Each class is a “doubles,” with
            two
            Houses. There's a non-editable Google Sheet with a sample series of schedules for all years and classes,
            and
            an editable Excel sheet.</li>
        <li>“<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/uio4yr/new_hogwarts_curriculum/" rel="nofollow">New
                Hogwarts Curriculum</a>,” by CyberWolfWrites, suggests an alternative set of classes, e.g. replacing
            1st
            and 2nd Year Charms and Transfiguration with Magical Theory, which teaches the principles of those
            classes
            as well as basic spell and wand theory, Latin, and runes; and adding the 6th-7th Year elective Business
            &amp; Estate Studies. There is also a basic schedule: three meals, three blocks before and after lunch,
            and
            curfews according to Year.</li>
        <li>“<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c46bl2/hogwarts_curriculum_worldbuilding_resource/"
                rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Curriculum World-Building Resource</a>,” by KillAutolockers, is an intensive
            breakdown of classes across years, starting with a basic summary (e.g. 1st Year Charms covers Locomotion
            Charms and Functional Charms) and then providing details. For example, the entry for 1st Year Charms
            describes the theory/practical breakdown and which spells are taught (and whether the lessons are
            practical
            or theoretical), while 1st Year Potions, which focuses on “Safety and Procedures” (in addition to
            brewing
            potions, of course), describes the principles that are taught (e.g. dressing appropriately, equipment
            maintenance), as well as the potions to be taught in that year.</li>

    <h2>Study Materials</h2>
    <p>Parchment is generally of a higher quality than paper, and it's apparently nicer to write on if you're some
        sort
        of connoisseur of writing media. Paper only won out over parchment as it became far, far cheaper to produce,
        but
        given <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/42103392/chapters/112949041" rel="nofollow">the principles
            that
            I sketch out in Wizardnomics</a>, the raw material costs of parchment and paper are almost identical.
        This
        is why wixes still rely on parchment.</p>

    <p>Some students, especially Muggle-borns, buy blank notebooks in which to record notes, but most students
        record
        their notes in two ways: (1) in the margins of their textbooks and (2) on loose pages, which are then bound
        together at a later point. I don't know whether I'd prefer for the pages to be bound near the end of each
        year
        around exams (which would produce a set of seven volumes for each student by graduation, which feels like a
        nice
        encapsulation of your time at Hogwarts) or upon graduation from Hogwarts. In Renaissance Europe, students
        would
        typically bind their notes upon the conclusion of their studies, so the latter is more historically
        grounded,
        but wixes have been going their own way for centuries by this point and a little bit of divergence is more
        than
        fine. If the topic is of interest to you, then I recommend “<a
            href="https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4774908/blair_notetaking.pdf?sequence=1" rel="nofollow">
            The Rise of Note-Taking in Early Modern Europe</a>.”</p>

    <p><a name="back2" rel="nofollow" id="back2"></a>There are various methods of indexing a notebook on the go. One
        of
        the most popular systems, which was pioneered by John Locke, depends on a set of two pages lined with boxes,
        each one of which corresponds to a two-letter combination of a letter of the alphabet and one vowel that
        might
        follow (e.g. Aa, Ae, Ai…Pu, Py, Qu, Ra, Re…).<a href="#note2" rel="nofollow"><sup>2</sup></a> When you
        intend to
        write something new, you first come up with a keyword to head that entry, and then check whether there is an
        entry in the index that corresponds to the first two letters of that keyword. If there is not, then you go
        to
        the next free page in your book, mark down the page number in the index, and proceed to write. The
        combination
        “CA” in the index might therefore read “Ca 12, 13, 28, 46,” and address everything from cats to
        cantaloupes.

    <p>It's harder to learn how to write well with a quill than with another kind of pen (to say nothing of
        pencils),
        but for most of the time that there's been a choice between quills and more modern pens — which have existed
        in
        one form or another for thousands of years — people have generally thought that quills were capable of more
        beautiful writing. Evidently, wixes agree, and fountain pens and their descendants have largely been
        rejected.
        It's true that Muggle-Borns and some Half-Bloods suffer for the fact that they haven't learned how to use
        quills
        by the time that they get to Hogwarts, but for many wixes it's probably icing on the cake that quills make
        it
        easier to sort out the riffraff. As Lucius Malfoy might say, you can often tell someone's background just by
        the
        way that they write their signature.</p>
    <h1>School Government and Organization</h1>
    <h2>Prefects</h2>
    <p>Ladyguinevere83 <a href="https://hp-essays.livejournal.com/160933.html?view=comments#comments" rel="nofollow">
            suggests </a> that Rowling's sense of the prefect system is informed by boarding school stories and that
        we
        can look to the same to learn more about Hogwarts prefects. Besides patrols, they might assist in the
        library,
        tend to visiting teachers, manage clubs, oversee pets, and supervise younger students during “prep” or
        homework
        periods. 83 discounts a couple of these, actually, but I personally don't think that the presence of Madam
        Pince, say, means that there can't be a prefect or two who also have librarian responsibilities, and prep
        might
        not be mandatory but that doesn't mean there couldn't be a voluntary prep to supervise. In addition to this,
        prefects probably distribute house passwords, definitely escort first years to the common room and supervise
        first and second years during (some?) break periods, and appear to generally lend support to teachers when
        greater manpower (wizardpower?) is required.</p>
    <h2>Departments</h2>
    <p>COS and GOF refers to “the Astronomy department,” and HBP refers to "the Transfiguration Department,"
        implying
        that there's more than one teacher per subject (there are more explicit references to this kind of setup in
        Pottermore, but they're hard to square with what we see in the books). If we accept this, then it's good to
        know
        how these departments might be organized.</p>

    <p>In the “Commonwealth system,” universities typically organize their teachers into a hierarchy of Professors,
        Readers, Senior Lecturers, and Lecturers.</p>

    <p>Professors are the seniormost members of their department, and in a small department there might be only one
        professor. Their position may be named after a specific individual that contributed to the school in general
        or
        to the creation (and funding!) of that position in particular. This contribution <em> usually </em>covers a
        stipend for the person that fills the professorship. A few examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>James Quick donated much of his wealth to Cambridge for the “study of vegetable and animal biology,”
            establishing the Quick Professorship.</li>
        <li>Henry Lucas bequeathed four thousand books and some land to Cambridge — whose income for the purpose of
            funding a “Professor of Mathematick” — thus establishing the Lucasian Professorship.</li>
        <li>The Simón Bolívar Professor is a visiting professorship at Cambridge that is funded by the government of
            Venezuela.</li>
        <li>The Ely Professor was funded by the city of Ely.</li>
        <li>Since 1497 (predating the Statute of Secrecy), there have been Regius Professorships that were
            established
            by royal patronage.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At Hogwarts, McGonagall might be the Gamp Professor of Transfiguration, the Regius Professor, or even the
        Holyhead Professor. One might also, referring to the office separately from McGonagall, talk about the Gamp
        Chair of Transfiguration or Holyhead Chair or whatever. Professorships whose funding is diverted or expired
        are
        said to be “suppressed.” All that said, not every professorship is named: the Yusuf Hamied 1702 Professor of
        Chemistry was originally just a “Professor of Chemistry,” renamed “Professor of Organic Chemistry” and then
        “BP
        1702 Professor of Organic Chemistry” after a donation from British Petroleum, and given its current title
        after
        a donation from Yusuf Hamied. The Professor of Music, meanwhile, has remained without tribute since its
        establishment in 1684.</p>

    <p>Readers have established a strong track record of original research. Lecturers may have permanent, tenured
        positions or be hired on a temporary basis (the latter sort may be called “associate lecturers” instead). At
        an
        institution like Hogwarts, promotion to senior lectureship is probably based mostly on teaching ability and
        further promotion is not assured, but the pay may be equivalent to a reader's.</p>

    <p>To my knowledge, the only Harry Potter story to mention readers is “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/38444569/chapters/96080992" rel="nofollow"> Victoria Potter and
            the
            Heir of Slytherin</a>,” by Taure, and even then the reference is fleeting:</p>
    <blockquote>

        <p>For the second year in a row, Victoria found herself without a Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor.
            Unlike her first year, however, when Professor Quirrell had disappeared so close to the end of term that
            Professor Dumbledore had simply cancelled the class, this time they still had two months of lessons to
            go
            before summer would arrive. Their classes were therefore covered by Madam Wigmore, one of the two
            Readers in
            the Defence department who had been studying under Professor Lockhart.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>But why take higher education as our model? Rowling alone knows the exact reason, but she chose to staff
        Hogwarts
        with professors, and professors are a characteristic of universities (at least in the UK). If I had to
        guess, or
        at least give a Watsonian explanation, the reason is that Hogwarts developed at a time when "a school to
        which
        children are sent from a far distance — perhaps even a completely different country" can be described only
        as
        a<em>university</em>, and the Founders themselves might have called it such. The idea of a university for
        adult
        education along was a later development, from which Hogwarts might have been shielded by the Statute of
        Secrecy.</p>
    <h2>Board of Governors</h2>
    <p>Canonically, we know that Hogwarts is a board of governors, that the board has twelve members, and that they
        have
        the authority to suspend or fire the Headmaster and to shutdown the school. Beyond this, we have to infer
        from
        the text and from the British school system in general.</p>

    <p>Board members are usually organized into committees with purviews such as admissions, audit and risk,
        curriculum
        and standards, discipline, finance and resources, health and safety, pupil progress, site management, and
        staffing. “Working groups” may also be formed to tackle specific problems. It is required for a board of
        governors to meet three times a year, and they typically meet no oftener than that.</p>

    <p>The board probably has a chair, who is elected by the board and helps to conduct meetings. Their term usually
        lasts for one year. In the COS video game, Lucius Malfoy was the chair of the Hogwarts board.</p>
    <h3>Membership</h3>
    <p>Typically, a board of governors will include the Head Teacher (or other administrator), but in COS the
        actions of
        the board are often presented as news to Dumbledore, and the Order of Suspension bears “all twelve
        signatures”
        of the board. Likewise, there are often “staff governors,” who are members of (and elected by) the staff,
        but it
        seems unlikely that any of the staff members in COS would have acted to suspend Dumbledore. If at some point
        there were staff governors, they might follow the practice of Muggle boards: at least one must be a teacher,
        and, if there are three or more staff governors, at least one other must be a member of the support staff
        (such
        as Filch or Pince).</p>

    <p>Parent governors are parents to current students, though in most cases they are able to serve the remainder
        of
        their term if their child graduates, and are elected by the same. If there are insufficient eligible
        candidates,
        parent governors may also be parents to former students. Authority governors are nominated by the local
        education authority (perhaps the Ministry). There may also be governors who are present on behalf of other
        organizations that sponsor the school, and these are called foundation, partnership, or sponsor governors.
        For
        example, religious schools often include one or more clergy on the board of governors.</p>

    <p>Other individuals — even students, in principle — may be “co-opted” as associate members if they have
        specific
        skills and experience. For example, Sir John Ritblat retired as a governor at Dulwich College in 2008 but
        has
        been retained as a “Special Adviser on Property Matters.” These members are not governors per se and do not
        vote
        or take part in government. There may be a clerk whose duty is to provide advice, keep minutes and other
        records, handle correspondence, and so forth. Clerks are similar to associate members in that they are
        non-voting members of the board, but dissimilar in that they are paid (typically by the school).</p>

    <p>At Eton College, the majority of the board are elected by the provost and the fellows of the board. One of
        these
        must be an Oxford Alum, and another must be a Cambridge Alum. Besides these, one is nominated by the Council
        of
        the Royal Society, one is nominated by the Lord Chief Justice of England, and one is elected by the Head
        Master,
        Lower Master, and Assistant Masters.</p>
    <h3>Authority</h3>
    <p>The mission of a board of governors, at least in the Muggle world, is to provide vision and direction for the
        school, hold the headteacher to account for the school's performance, and oversee the financial performance
        of
        the school.</p>

    <p>Both the board of governors and the Ministry of Magic have some amount of control over Hogwarts, but it isn't
        clear where they stand in relation to one another. Malfoy states in COS that “the appointment — or
        suspension —
        of the headmaster is a matter for the governors,” even above Fudge's protests, but Educational Degree No. 28
        puts Umbridge in place as Headmaster. In the same chapter of OOTP we are told that “the Ministry of Magic
        passed
        new legislation giving itself an unprecedented level of control at Hogwarts,” which suggests that the
        Ministry
        had some control to begin with. Ministry influence is also indicated by one of the memories which Tom Riddle
        shows to Harry in COS, in which Dippet says that “the Ministry of Magic is even now talking about closing
        the
        school.”</p>

    <p>Speaking of Educational Degrees, the first which we hear about is Educational Degree No. 22, which issued on
        August 30th, and the last is Educational Degree No. 29, which Umbridge doesn't last long enough to put into
        force. It seems unlikely to me that more than twenty Educational Degrees would be issued in the space of two
        or
        three months and then only half a dozen more in the following school year, so I believe that other
        Educational
        Degrees were issued in the past.</p>

    <p>Prior to Educational Degree No. 22, the board of governors may be responsible for reviewing appointments to
        the
        staff. They may be able to review exclusions (suspensions and expulsions) of students and either reinstate
        students or reduce (but not increase) the term of their exclusion.</p>
    <h1>Hogwarts Library</h1>
    <p>Hogwarts was founded somewhen during the 11th century, give or take a century, and its library might have
        been
        organized or reorganized at any point thereafter. It would be well for us to begin with a look at Medieval
        European libraries, such as they were.</p>
    <h2>Organizational Schemes</h2>
    <p>Besides subject matter, books might be organized in a catalog by author, by origin (including donor), or by
        language. A book's position in a catalog did not necessarily mean anything about its position in the
        library,
        either. Catalogs might record the “incipit” or opening words of a particular page (usually the second or
        third
        page) and the “explicit” or final words of a page at the end of the book, as well as information like page
        size,
        columns per page, manner of binding, and descriptions of insignia and illustrations. Further complicating
        the
        issue was that multiple texts could be bound in the same volume, but only the first text would be described
        by
        the catalog. You might not care about any of that when you just want a reference book for your essay on
        goblin
        rebellions, but Medieval European catalogs were primarily for the benefit of the librarians, who wanted an
        inventory to guard against loss, and were rarely consulted by library patrons (who were expected to ask the
        librarian).</p>

    <p>Most libraries, and therefore most library catalogs, were kept by monasteries, which predominantly kept
        religious
        works. It should thus come as no surprise that a catalog might have a dozen categories for different kinds
        of
        religious writing and throw together medicine and geography into the same group.</p>

    <p>Medieval Europeans consistently distinguished between poetry and prose. Some catalogs combined “Christian”
        and
        “Pagan” poetry, and others intermixed them. Books might also be categorized according to the subject of time
        (e.g. history, the computation of time, liturgy) or law (civil law, canon or religious law, monastic rules),
        and
        these might be divided more finely (a distinction between “secular history” and “church history,” for
        example).
    </p>
    <h3>Historical Systems</h3>
    <p>By 1497, the catalog at St. Augustine's Abbey organized books into the following categories: (1) Bibles and
        other
        religious works; (2) natural history; (3) philosophy; (4) music; (5) geometry; (6) astronomy; (7) medicine;
        (8)
        logic; (9) grammar; (10) poetry; (11) books in French and English; (12) alchemy; (13) miscellaneous items);
        and
        (14) canon law.</p>

    <p>In a catalog belonging to Norwich Cathedral Priory, the books were categorized according to their donor as
        well
        as the following attributes: (1) Books with the letter mark “A”; (2) books obtained between 1272 and 1325,
        bearing a press-mark and an inscription of ownership; (3) books obtained after 1325, bearing a press-mark
        and an
        inscription of ownership; (4) books bearing only a press-mark; and (5) books without a press-mark.</p>

    <p>At Christ Church Priory, the books were organized into the following categories, in order: (1) Grammar, (2)
        Rhetoric, (3) Music, (4) Philosophy, (5) Poetry, (6) Astronomy, (7) Miscellaneous, and (8) Law.</p>

    <p>Other common categories in monastic libraries include: (1) biblical manuscripts; (2) canon (or religious)
        law;
        (3) civil law; (4) hagiography, or the lives of the saints; (5) history and geography, both church and
        secular;
        (6) homilies, lectionaries, psalters, antiphonaries, and missals; (7) martyrology; (8) medicine; (9)
        monastic
        rules; (10) scriptural commentaries and other works by the Church Fathers and other religious philosophers;
        and
        (11) miscellaneous shit.</p>

    <p>Francis Bacon recommended organizing books into History (e.g. civil history, natural history), Philosophy
        (e.g.
        natural philosophy, philosophy of man, theology), and Poetry (allegory and mythology, dramatic, narrative or
        heroic), or rather Memory, Reason, and Imagination, with further subdivisions such as those described
        parenthetically.</p>

    <h3>The Seven Arts</h3>
    <p>In Medieval Europe, a classical education in the liberal arts (Artes Liberales) was was often organized into
        two
        categories: the Trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and
        astronomy). This was distinguished from practical subjects like architecture, which might be organized into
        seven mechanical arts (Artes Mechanicae), and were sometimes considered foundational to three “high
        faculties,”
        these beings Law, Medicine, and Theology (which incorporated what we might today distinguish as
        “philosophy”).
        Grammarian and rhetorical texts might be intermixed, and might also be classified with poetry as “arts of
        language,” not least because poetry was often analyzed and discussed in the teaching of grammar and
        rhetoric.
    </p>

    <p>One philosopher organized the Artes Mechanicae into <em>agricultura </em>(agriculture), <em>architectura
        </em>(architecture, masonry), <em>coquinaria </em>(cooking), <em>mercatura </em>(trade), <em>metallaria
        </em>(blacksmithing, metallurgy), <em>militia </em>and <em>venatoria </em>(warfare and hunting, "martial
        arts"),
        and <em>vestiaria </em>(tailoring, weaving). Another listed medicine, navigation, and the theatrical arts in
        place of agriculture, cooking, and trade. There have occasionally been lists of seven “fine arts,” but none
        so
        authoritative as the Artes Liberales or even the Artes Mechanicae. If we use the “Artes Elegantes” as a
        category, along with a fourth, “Artes Magicae,” then we could use something like the following to organize
        the
        Hogwarts Library.</p>

    <p>“Healing” is one of the Artes Magicae rather than Artes Mechanicae because Healers mostly don't use tools. In
        the
        modern world there are new arts, like photography and radio, which may be incorporated into existing
        categories
        (e.g. photography as a form of painting), inspire a complete recategorization (removing calligraphy as a
        primary
        art in order to list photography in its place), or simply ignored and placed in some nebulous
        “miscellaneous”
        section.</p>

    <p>Even these categories could be further broken down.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Divination could be subdivided into (1) astrology, (2) card reading, (3) crystal gazing (looking into a
            mirror, or “speculating,” is a branch thereof), (4) dream interpretation, (5) exotic practices (anything
            not
            covered elsewhere), (6) fire omens, and (7) palmistry.</li>
        <li>Transfiguration could be subdivided into (1) conjuration, (2) human transfiguration, (3) switching, (4)
            transubstantial transfiguration (what usually comes to mind when one thinks of transfiguration), (5)
            untransfiguration, (6) vanishment, and… I'm not sure what the seventh ought to be.</li>
        <li>Philosophy is a “catch-all” category for more complex forms of magic, such as alchemy.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Others might be spun off into their own collections. For example, “hunting, strategy, and warfare” might be
        made
        into the <em> Artes Martiale </em>, composed of (1) dueling (with wands), (2) fighting with sharp-edged
        weapons,
        (3) grappling and wrestling, (4) hunting, (5) logistics and strategy, (6) tactics, and (7) tracking and
        trapping, or some other combination (replacing “grappling and wrestling” with a more general “pankration” or
        “unarmed fighting,” for example, or dividing logistics and strategy or combining them with tactics and then
        adding archery or horsemanship).</p>

        imagined that there would be considerably more than forty students in each year at Hogwarts, I thought that
        it
        would be useful to know a proportion of Harry's classmates, and to have names at my fingertips when action
        was
        taking place around the school.”<sup><a href="#back1" rel="nofollow">[ ▲ ]</a></sup></p>
