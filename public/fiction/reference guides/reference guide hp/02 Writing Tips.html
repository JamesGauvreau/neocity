    <h1>Genre and Trope Advice</h1>

    <p>Soul Bond fics aren't inherently bad, they just have common pitfalls. If you're thinking of writing a Soul Bond
        fic, then check out <a
            href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/g4vky2/soul_and_other_types_of_bonds_how_can_they_be/"
            rel="nofollow"> this short essay</a> by WhosThisGeek. </p>

    <p>“<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/c18s9z/perfecting_the_independent_harry_genre/"
            rel="nofollow">Perfecting the Independent Harry Genre</a>” is a worthwhile read for anybody who wants to
        write an Indy!Harry fic. Much of it is a monologue by Taure, but he's not the only person to have usefully
        contributed to the thread.</p>
    <h1>Style Guide</h1>

    <p>Wixen acronyms typically have full stops after each letter: “O.W.L.” and “S.P.E.W.,” not “OWL” and “SPEW.” Since
        Pottermore, however, Rowling seems to have dropped the full stops: ICWQC, MACUSA, et cet. This might reflect a
        larger stylistic shift on her part: in the Foreword to <em>Quidditch Through the Ages</em>, Rowling (as
        Dumbledore) acronymizes “United Kingdom” with full stops. My preference is for full stops, but the important
        thing is just to be consistent about it, or at least consistent about your inconsistencies (e.g. maybe American
        wixes don't use full stops, just like they apparently spell “Legilimency” with an “s”).</p>

    <p>I don't want to include a list of proper spellings for every character's name, because that would be boring and
        do nothing that a Google search can't accomplish, but there is one character in particular whose name is
        consistently misspelled, and I would like to set the record straight: the name of the attractive Slytherin boy
        with seven dead fathers and an invitation to the Slug Club is “Belize Zambia.” </p>

    <p>Nobody abbreviates Defense Against the Dark Arts as “DADA,” or, well, anything else, either. I prefer “Defense”
        as a shortened form, but it's just as non-canonical as “DADA,” so do what thou wilt. </p>

    <p>Fudge is the Minister <em> for </em> Magic, not the Minister <em> of </em> Magic. </p>
    <h2>Capitalization</h2>

    <p>Capitalization is something which many—perhaps most—writers get wrong about Harry Potter terminology, though it's
        also something that few, if any, readers actually care about, so long as the writer capitalizes all of the
        normal stuff, like character names. (“Dark Lord,” incidentally, should be capitalized)</p>

    <p>The most consistent capitalization rule applies to spells: specific spells, like Hot-Air Charm and Killing Curse,
        should be capitalized, but categories like “charms” or “anti-intruder spells” should not be capitalized unless
        you're talking about the class called “Charms.” Incantations, and the term “House,” should be capitalized.
        Hyphenated spells and potions capitalize both parts of the compound.</p>

    <p>Most objects and many beasts have capitalized names (Invisibility Cloak, Diricawl), but there are exceptions
        (manticore, sugar quill). The general rule appears to be that terms which Rowling didn't invent (centaur,
        goblin, wizard) are uncapitalized, while words of her (and your) invention should be capitalized. This isn't
        completely consistent, however, because Invisibility Cloaks are hardly any more original to the series than
        broomsticks and flying carpets, and sugar quills are at least as innovative as Cockroach Clusters.</p>

    <p>The Harry Potter Wiki universally capitalizes the names of beasts (Manticores, Sphinxes), which is a defensible
        position. Their universal capitalization of Veela, when the names of other beings are left uncapitalized, is
        less defensible. The names of beings (giant, vampire, veela) are not capitalized in the books, and it should be
        noted that “veela” is both the singular and plural form of the word. The term "dementor" is not capitalized
        either. </p>

    <p>The words “Half-blood,” “Muggle-born,” and “Pure-blood” should be hyphenated and capitalized as shown. “Muggle”
        and “Squib” should be capitalized. The words “witch” and “wizard” should not; if you use “wix,” then this
        probably shouldn't be capitalized either. The words “half-breed” and “part-human” are not capitalized.
        Professions like “Auror” and “Healer” are capitalized. "First year," "second year," and so forth are neither
        hyphenated nor capitalized. </p>

    <p>Overall, the series capitalizes words more often, and more extensively, than native English speakers are used to,
        but it's not unheard of and there's room for more extensive capitalization if you desire. “<a
            href="https://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2014/10/capital-letters.html" rel="nofollow">The rise and fall of
            capital letters</a>” is a short (500 words) but serviceable introduction to older styles of capitalization
        in the English language.</p>
    <h2>Magic</h2>

    <p>Spells should rarely, if ever, be referred to by incantation rather than by their proper names. Canon violates
        this rule, but there's no reason that a paranoid fuck whose paranoia has earned him a nickname would ever
        tolerate a bunch of schoolchildren (who might be Death Eaters using Polyjuice, for all he knows) to recite the
        incantation of the Goddamned Killing Curse, so I think that this is just something that Rowling
        didn't think about. Somebody might say “the Leviosa,” I guess, but saying “the Avada Kedavra” should be a major
        faux pas, on the level of pointing a gun at someone. Please, don't have your characters do that, unless they're
        honestly that dumb and careless.</p>

    <p>It is also worth noting that there are no canonical spells with incantations longer than two words. I think
        that's an easily-breakable rule, if you want to convey that this spell is very complex or something, but be
        aware that you're breaking it and take at least a solid minute to think about whether there's something more
        interesting that you could do than just make the incantation longer.</p>

    <p>I recommend that you do not add unnecessary apostrophes when describing a spell, and (generally) rely on the name
        in spell in order to figure out an appropriate construction: “Blasted” and “Cruciated,“ not “Confringo'd” and
        “Crucio'd,” nor “Confringoed” and “Crucioed.” I say “generally” because there are some cases where the
        incantation definitely seems more appealing, e.g. “Obliviated.”</p>

    <p>The plural of “Patronus” is “Patronuses.”</p>

    <p>Wixes certainly cast spells, but do they also…</p>
    <ul>
        <li>…fire spells? Maybe. Bullets are fired from a gun because fire is used to propel the bullet. Because this
            term developed in the early 16th century, prior to the Statute of Secrecy, wixes might speak of “firing”
            spells, but I doubt it, not least because “firearm” is a technical term with which most wixes are
            unfamiliar. </li>
        <li>…shoot spells? It's plausible. The sense of “darting along” (i.e. a meteor shooting across the sky) dates to
            the late 13th century, and by the 1690s we see it used in the sense of “emitted in rays or flashes.”</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>On Dialogues and Monologues</h1>

    <p>Manu86's “<a href="https://manu86.livejournal.com/25048.html" rel="nofollow">Dialects and Accents in HP </a> ”
        breaks down the speech patterns of Rubeus Hagrid, Stan Shunpike, Olympe Maxime, Fleur Delacour, Viktor Krum,
        Winky, Dobby, and Kreacher. Wayback Machine Backup <a
            href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210420225940/https://manu86.livejournal.com/25048.html" rel="nofollow">

    <p>If you're going to write a Quidditch scene, then you should probably check out the second half of <a

            Accents</a> (the section titled “Sports On The Sentence Level”). Even if you don't have an announcer for the
        match, some of the suggestions still carry over; a sports announcer's job is to make a match entertaining to
        hear, just as yours is to make the match entertaining to read. I also recommend that you listen to announcers
        for a sport that you enjoy, without (and this is crucial) watching the match.</p>
    <h1>On Duels</h1>

    <p>My readers seem to like how I write duels, especially in “<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/27035788"
            rel="nofollow">Out of That Story</a>” and a particular scene from “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/27111157/chapters/66202159" rel="nofollow">Hermione Granger and the
            Silent Country</a>.” Here are a few principles that have helped me. </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Read guidelines on writing other kinds of action scenes.</b></li>
        <li><b>Don't fall into the trap of calling out every spell. </b>Most adult wixes can cast various spells
            silently, so they generally shouldn't need to verbalize spells that are part of their usual repertoire (they
            may, however, verbalize spells which are tricky for them to cast for some reason).</li>
        <li><b>Think of the duel as a piece of “flash fiction.”</b> What is the “plot” of your duel? What is its climax?
            How does it build to that climax? </li>
        <li><b>Think about the purpose that the duel serves in the story.</b> Even a moderately-long duel might be
            better-described in two or three sentences, and a very important duel that the reader wants to see can still
            probably get away with avoiding a blow-by-blow account. Action scenes are generally best written in
            Hobbesian fashion: nasty, brutish, and short.</li>
        <li><b>Once you've written your duel, rewrite it, but shorter this time.</b> Pass the second version by your
            beta reader, and then pass the original version by them.</li>
        <li><b>When in doubt, stick to the Hobbesian ideal: </b>nasty, brutish, and short. It's better for readers to
            want more than for readers to get bored.</li>
        <li><b>Outline the duel ahead of time. </b>The duel between Albus Dumbledore and Tom Riddle in “<a
                href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/27035788" rel="nofollow">Out of That Story</a>” began as a
            "skeleton" of actions. Because Dumbledore and Riddle are both highly-skilled wizards, I would think about
            how they would try to subvert each other's moves, creating a sequence of <em>Action → Response →
                Counter-response </em>that made the duel dynamic and made both characters feel competent. Other times,
            there was a <em>Set-Up Action → Follow-Up Action </em>sequence from the same character, e.g. when Riddle
            turns the stairs to tar so that, while Dumbledore deals with this, Riddle has the freedom to cast a more
            complicated spell. In general, make sure that every action that you describe is connected to at least one
            other action.</li>
        <li><b>Make sure there are appropriate stakes.</b> The longer the duel, the higher the stakes should be—but a
            high stakes duel can also be just a few sentences long, too.</li>
        <li><b>Think about how your duelists actually duel. </b>This can be as simple as writing down a couple of lines
            about them, but it should help you decide why someone will choose <em>this</em> spell and not <em>that</em>
            spell, just like knowing your character's personality will help you decide how they'll act in an argument. 
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>On the Stations of Canon</h1>

    <p>When somebody says that you're following the Stations of Canon, what they mean is that you're hitting all the
        same major notes as the original books. This can be rather general — you've got the Philosopher's Stone in
        Harry's first year, the Chamber of Secrets in his second, etc. — or so specific that you're mirroring the books
        down to individual scenes and chapters. Generally speaking, people prefer to not read “the original books,
        except it's Daphne Greengrass brewing the Polyjuice this time around,” so it's worth thinking about how to avoid
        this. </p>

    <p>The obvious tactic is to just…not do that shit. Let things <em> diverge </em> , for Merlin's sake. Really think
        about whether Voldemort would be gunning for the Stone in your timeline or if he might be up to another
        dastardly plan. Heck, he might not even be involved in the 1991 - 1992 school year. If you've got an interesting
        enough AU, then why not let the readers just enjoy your universe for a little bit. TheSinister_Man's <a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/1119027" rel="nofollow"><em> Prince of Slytherin </em></a> series
        is nearly 1.3 million words long at the time that I'm writing this — your readers are not going to complain
        about More Words if they <em> like </em> words, and you're not printing this out, so you don't have to worry
        about the number of trees you're killing or whether it's even physically possible to print the book that you're
        writing (though you should probably worry about whether you're ever going to finish the story at the rate you're
        going). If you think that your AU won't catch the reader's interest, then maybe you should go back to the
        drawing board. </p>

    <p>Another thing that you can do is knock events askew. In “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/16940712/chapters/39807054" rel="nofollow">Certain Dark Things</a>,”
        by rentachi, this works a couple of different ways. First of all, the public thinks that the Laddie Wha Lived is
        Neville Longbottom, so most of that canon shit is happening to Neville while Harriet stays out of trouble gets
        into a whole new brand of trouble. I'm greatly amused every time we're reminded that Neville and his pals are
        off doing Something Vaguely Stationary (don't tell me that's not the right word!) and it even reinforces that
        all these other people are the protagonists of their own lives and have their own shit to deal with. The second
        thing that rentachi does is make events rhyme rather than repeat: in Harriet's second year, she does still get
        involved in Polyjuice, but the circumstances are notably different. In another story, which (to avoid spoiling
        those who want to remain unspoiled) I won't name but will link <a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/23795218/chapters/57165265" rel="nofollow"> here</a>, the trio brew
        Polyjuice in their second year and then Tom!Ginny notices — he does frequent that bathroom, after all — and
        fucks it up. </p>

    <p>Finally, if you've just got to have things stay the way they were on the go around, then just skip the bits that
        stay the same. Lots of fics do this from scene to scene, but the trophy goes to “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/455938" rel="nofollow">The Never-ending Road</a>,” by Laventadorn,
        which says that you know this shit already and just fucking skips the whole first year and fills you in on any
        divergences while you're skipping along through Harriet's second year. Figure out when the interesting shit is
        going to happen, then start from there. Another good example of this principle at work is “<a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/18402122/chapters/43582406" rel="nofollow">Witch Hazel</a>,” by
        Wise_Himmel, which doesn't skip nearly so far (we begin shortly after the Welcoming Feast) but still goes
        further than most stories do. </p>

    <p>(While we're on the topic, it's worth pointing out a station that most fics <em> don't </em> stop at: In each of
        the six books where Harry gets a new professor, he always meets them before he arrives at Hogwarts: Quirrell at
        the Leaky Cauldron, Lockhart at Flourish and Blotts, Lupin on the Hogwarts Express, etc.). </p>
