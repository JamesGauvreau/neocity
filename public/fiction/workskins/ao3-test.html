    <p>Macbeth, the generous king of the Scots (d. 1057), was the son of Findlay, earl of Moray, who was murdered by his nephews in 1020. The first of these nephews died in 1029, passing the realm to the other nephew, Gillecomgain. In 1032 this Gillecomgain was slain by the vengeful hand of Macbeth, upon which occasion he took the earldom of Moray as his rightful possession, and with kindness and all honour took Gillecomgain's wife and son as his own.</p>
