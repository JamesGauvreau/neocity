    <h1>6/26/23</h1>
    <p>Worked on the personal website assignment today. Messing around wth flex boxes a little more, but haven't quite gotten the hang of them yet.</p>
    <p>Worked on a couple of <i>Black Star</i> items. 

    <h1>6/23/23</h1>
    <p>Worked on <a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">deploy-to-neocities</a> today, which required me to get into Github Actions for the first time. In the fourth stage, "Install deps and build," I encountered a series of npm errors, ending with <span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">Error: Process completed with exit code 254</span>. I posted about it in the discussion thread but I'll also do some digging on my end this weekend. 

    <h1>6/22/23</h1>
    <p>Started work on a project called <i>Black Star</i> today.</p>
    <p>Current problems include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sizing the sun correctly. A square might not be so bad but I'd like to actively choose to go with a square and not just fall back to it.</li>
        <li>The colors on Andrew Ib and its satellite are wrong. Gotta figure out why.</li>
        <li><del>There are spaces in the red bar where spaces ought not to be. I probably messed up the grid.</del> <small>[6/26/23]</small></li>
        <li><del>Deal with the whitespace on the margins... (much easier if I go with the square alone, but see above)</del> <small>[6/26/23]</small></li>
        <ul>
            <li><small>[Update 6/26/23]</small> Incomplete fix, needs further work. 
        </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <p>Other things to do before it's complete:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Getting the spacing right between the Andrew object cluster.</li>
        <li>Getting the spacing right between object clusters(near-last task).</li>
        <li>The black and white strips of binary.</li>
        <li>The unblue square.</li>
        <li>Another object cluster (klemperer rosette with orbit trails?) or two.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is mostly a CSS thing, so I shouldn't spend too much time on it. Ideally, one item every week or two, and only if I'm making good progress on other stuff.</p>
    <p>Another thing that I'd like to do, maybe later this week, is work on hooking up Neocities to Github. If you can read this, then I got around to doing that.
