            <p>Working on an exercise from freeCodeCamp. Completely borked it by using <samp>&lt;=</samp> instead of <samp>&gt;=</samp>. Oops.</p>
            <p>On that note, I'm not sure that the third step is working like it should &ndash; the instructions recommended useing the <code>getGrade</code> function, but that was entirely unnecessary.</p>

            <h1>2/17/25</h1>
            <p>I decided to get back to working with git from the terminal, because I couldn't remember all the steps. I had a brief issue when I went to push &ndash; being told <code>error: src refspec main does not match any</code>, so I tried <code>git branch</code>. Turns out that somewhere, somehow, I'd named this branch <code>main</code> instead of <code>master</code>. Oops.</p>

            <h1>2/15/25</h1>
            <p>After migrating computers, had an issue pulling down the Neocities repo, but another repo worked just fine. I had previously worked in Ubuntu, but VS Code is supposed to function for Windows, so it couldn't simply be that I was running on the wrong OS.</p>
            <p>Error messages included <samp>Unable to read file: ENOENT: no such file or directory</samp> and <samp>Clone succeeded, but checkout failed.</samp> Some of these messages were explicable, like the one that told me that I wasn't working in a git repo. Others, less so.</p>
            <p>The output at least identified one file that was causing a problem. Some Googling suggested that the problem had to do with file size, which...was odd, but I downloaded a few other things and tried some configurations meant to alleviate this. No dice.</p>
            <p>Going back to the file identified in the output, I decided to shorten the name and see what happened. It worked! There was a new file identified as a problem, but that was alright, I was going to keep going at this. After I edited the second file name, everything was fine and I cloned my repo.</p>
            <p>Then, trying to rename the two problem files, I was told that I was typing an invalid name.</p>
            <p>It turns out that I <i>was</i> running on the wrong OS, as it turns out. Linux allows colons in file names, but Windows doesn't. Shortening the file names fixed the problem completely by accident: not because the file names were somehow too long but because they had colons in them.</P>
                <p>Upshot: I need to be aware of the subtle differences between operating systems, because something that works fine in one situation may completely fall apart in another because of a single character.</p>

            <p>Finally sort of solved an issue I'd been having with deploy-to-neocities: either <samp>uses:</samp> needed to say <samp>actions/checkout@v4</samp> (and not @2 or even @3) and/or I needed to get rid of the zone identifiers in my images folder.</p>

            <h1>10/30/23</h1>
            <p>I may be working on updating a website in the next week or two (still waiting to hear back). It hasn't been updated in forever, and I've had to learn a bit about File Transfer Protocols in order to properly edit any files. I'm working with WinSCP, which is straightforward enough, and I've been able to add files and edit the files that I've added, but occasionally I've run into  an error that states <samp>error transferring file copying files to remote side failed</samp>. I've been able to work around it and some cursory googling suggests that it might go away if I'm just patient, but I'll dig further if it continues to be a problem.</p>
            <p><i>Later update:</i> While the initial problem persists, I am permitted to rename files with abandon, so it's a simple matter of turning <samp>services.html</samp> into <samp>services1.html</samp>, and then creating a new <samp>services.html</samp> file which I'm permitted to edit.</p>

            <h1>10/28/23</h1>
            <p>For the past few months, I've been running into a problem where VS Code won't open properly and access Linux. Restarting my computer always fixes the issue. It doesn't seem to be related to permissions â€” today I was able to access the relevant folders in Windows Explorer even when VS Code was unable to do so, when before the problem seemed connected. Forcing a shutdown of VS Code only made things worse, but, thankfully, restarting my computer fixed everything back up again.</p>
            <p>I would like to get this solved someday. Restarting my computer takes longer than I would like.</p>

            <h1>10/26/23</h1>
            <p>By far the most frustrating thing about Deploy to Neocities is that if the intended upload is too big, then the tool won't work and I have to manually adjust things. It's another good reason to make sure that my commits are tiny and regular, I suppose.</p>

            <h1>7/24/23</h1>
            <p>Work continues on Ultraviolet Milk Run. Right now, I'm trying to find a way to refer to variables which (1) exist outside a function and (2) are affected by variables whose value was changed in the function. For example, if the value of A is "1" and the value of B is "A + 1," then printing the value of B will initially get "2." If I call on a function which increases A by 1 and then, within that function, print B, then I want to print "3" ((B = A + 1) = (B = 2 + 1) in this case). It's not a big deal to reprint every step, but if there are too many functions or variables involved then it'll get clunky fast. I'll need to figure out an elegant if/else in order to run multiple button clicks through the same route without forgetting the origin, but that should be simpler.' </p>

            <h1>7/21/23</h1>
            <p>Worked on a class project today. I'll have more to say about it when I find out how I did, but I'm making this note here to remind Future Salt to make a comment.</p>
            <p>Also started work on "Ultraviolet Milk Run," a little Javascript text game running on the Trade Routes table in Luka Rejec's <i>Ultraviolet Grasslands</i>. Figuring out how to modify a preexisting variable whose value had been stated earlier in text, which had to update as well, was a heck and a half to figure out. As usual, I was overthinking it and just needed to run <samp>document.getElementById</samp> again inside the function.</p>
            <p>Earlier this week, I worked a little on building my own API, but I ran into some weird problems and I found out that we're going to build our own APIs later in the course, so I'll set that aside from now.</p> 
            <p>Notes for the future:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>There's a Tampermonkey mod for FFN that I said I would write up for somebody. I should get that done this weekend.</li>
                <li>I should keep a running list of the projects that I'm working on, whenever I mention one, so that I don't start too many and finish none.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To that end:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Black Star</i></li>
                <li>Harry Potter Family Generator</li>
                <li>Ultraviolet Milk Run</li>
                <li>Actually working on my website</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Okay, I should probably add those Twine projects, too.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Twine adaption of Derin's "<a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/13501964/chapters/30964720">Alternamorphs 1</a>"</li>
                <li>Twine adaption of TheManWithaPlan's "<a href="https://forums.spacebattles.com/threads/little-death-dune-xenofiction.985693/?post=81256183#post-81256183">Little Death</a>"</li>

            <h1>7/12/23</h1>
            <p>Tried to create an <samp>Index of /*</samp> page for one of my image archives, but this didn't quite work. Looks like it might need php, which Neocities doesn't support. One suggestion I found was to build what I needed on <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> and then pull from Glitch via API.</p>
            <p>Other interesting things that I found in the course of looking for a solution:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://catbox.moe/">Catbox</a>, a file hosting service. </li>
                <li><a href="https://autoindex.sourceforge.net/">AutoIndex PHP Script</a> Might use this one later.</li>
                <li><a href="https://github.com/ranoya/AutoIndex">AutoIndex</a>, by ranoya, isn't what I was looking for, but I still like it and will probably find a way to spruce up this site with it once some of my pages get larger.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I may need to refer to <a href="https://perishablepress.com/wp/wp-content/images/2008/directories/floyd-02.gif">this</a> later.</p>

            <h1>7/4/23</h1>
            <p>Giving Neocities time to cool off overnight, and then uploading the images in smaller batches, solved the 500 error (just uploading in smaller batches didn't work last night). I've sort of solved the image protection issue, but I don't really know <i>how</i>: too many asterisks, basically, but I'll need to find out why <samp>images/writing/fannish-archaeology/*</samp> and <samp>images/writing/*/*</samp> both worked, but <samp>images/*/*/*/*</samp> did not work.</p>
            <p>Still not sure why the images deleted from the website were still displaying on AO3, because it definitely wasn't anything to do with my browser's cache. Maybe there's a lag on AO3's end? After it did lose the images, though, it was very quick to regain them as soon as I uploaded them back to my archives.

            <h1>7/3/23</h1>
            <p>Just about done with the process of reorganizing the Neocity and setting up everything on VS Code. I
                ran into trouble due to one particularly large image that I was trying to upload. For now, I'll have
                to live with manually uploading images for now, but <del>I've successfully protected the images folder
                    from being cleaned up</del>, so the main problem will just be that live previews will look ugly on
                VS
                Code. </p>

            <p>No, I haven't successfully protected the images. I'm rather confused by what's going on here, so I'll
                give it a few days. 

            <p>Issues to handle later:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>500 error when uploading images.</li>
                <li>Images aren't being protected like they should be.</li>
                <li>Images have been deleted from the website but are still displaying on AO3 in contravention of all reason and God's law.</li>

            <h1>6/30/23</h1>
            <p>Been working on Javascript the past few days. A bit tricky at first, but getting the hang of loops. I
                also found a useful extension for VS Code, <a
                    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap">Rewrap</a>, which
                improves
                the formatting of comments.</p>
            <p>Discovered <samp>&lt;samp&gt;</samp>, which formats text <samp>like so</samp>, as well as the escapes
                "&amp;lt" (lesser than) and "&amp;gt;" (greater than), which can produce &lt; and &gt; (and in order
                to
                type <i>those</i> as text, you need to type "&amp;amp;" (ampersand), and so on.
            <p>Making things look a little bit nicer on this page with <samp>&lt;section&gt;</samp> and
                <samp>&lt;article&gt;</samp>. I may want to make hotkeys for &amp;lt (lesser than) and &amp;gt; but
                that's a low priority.

            <h1>6/26/23</h1>
            <p>Worked on the personal website assignment today. Messing around wth flex boxes a little more, but
                haven't
                quite gotten the hang of them yet.</p>
            <p>Worked on a couple of <i>Black Star</i> items.
            <p>Bcomnes helped out with <a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">deploy-to-neocities</a>,
                and I was able to get the "exit code 254" error in order to encounter a brand-new error:
                <samp>JSONHTTPERROR: Forbidden</samp>. I'm pretty certain that I'm not making a mistake with the API
                key, and that the tool is no longer looking for errant JS code that isn't there to be found, so I'm
                not
                sure what's going on there.
            </p>
            <p><b>Update:</b> Bcomnes said that there was probably just a problem with the API token. Lo and behold,
                regenerating the API token a couple times worked.

            <p>Worked on <a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">deploy-to-neocities</a> today,
                which
                required me to get into Github Actions for the first time. In the fourth stage, "Install deps and
                build," I encountered a series of npm errors, ending with <samp>Error: Process completed with exit
                    code

            <p>Started work on a project called <i>Black Star</i> today.</p>
            <p>Current problems include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sizing the sun correctly. A square might not be so bad but I'd like to actively choose to go
                    with a
                    square and not just fall back to it.</li>
                <li>The colors on Andrew Ib and its satellite are wrong. Gotta figure out why.</li>
                <li><del>There are spaces in the red bar where spaces ought not to be. I probably messed up the
                        grid.</del> <small>[6/26/23]</small></li>
                <li><del>Deal with the whitespace on the margins... (much easier if I go with the square alone, but
                        see
                        above)</del> <small>[6/26/23]</small></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><small>[Update 6/26/23]</small> Incomplete fix, needs further work.
                </ul>

            </ul>
            <p>Other things to do before it's complete:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting the spacing right between the Andrew object cluster.</li>
                <li>Getting the spacing right between object clusters(near-last task).</li>
                <li>The black and white strips of binary.</li>
                <li>The unblue square.</li>
                <li>Another object cluster (klemperer rosette with orbit trails?) or two.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is mostly a CSS thing, so I shouldn't spend too much time on it. Ideally, one item every week or
                two, and only if I'm making good progress on other stuff.</p>
            <p>Another thing that I'd like to do, maybe later this week, is work on hooking up Neocities to Github.
                If
                you can read this, then I got around to doing that.
