            <h1>7/3/23</h1>
            <p>Just about done with the process of reorganizing the Neocity and setting up everything on VS Code. I
                ran into trouble due to one particularly large image that I was trying to upload. For now, I'll have
                to live with manually uploading images for now, but <del>I've successfully protected the images folder
                    from being cleaned up</del>, so the main problem will just be that live previews will look ugly on
                VS
                Code. </p>

            <p>No, I haven't successfully protected the images. I'm rather confused by what's going on here, so I'll
                give it a few days. 

            <p>Issues to handle later:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>500 error when uploading images.</li>
                <li>Images aren't being protected like they should be.</li>
                <li>Images have been deleted from the website but are still displaying on AO3 in contravention of all reason and God's law.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>6/30/23</h1>
            <p>Been working on Javascript the past few days. A bit tricky at first, but getting the hang of loops. I
                also found a useful extension for VS Code, <a
                    href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stkb.rewrap">Rewrap</a>, which
                improves
                the formatting of comments.</p>
            <p>Discovered <samp>&lt;samp&gt;</samp>, which formats text <samp>like so</samp>, as well as the escapes
                "&amp;lt" (lesser than) and "&amp;gt;" (greater than), which can produce &lt; and &gt; (and in order
                to
                type <i>those</i> as text, you need to type "&amp;amp;" (ampersand), and so on.
            <p>Making things look a little bit nicer on this page with <samp>&lt;section&gt;</samp> and
                <samp>&lt;article&gt;</samp>. I may want to make hotkeys for &amp;lt (lesser than) and &amp;gt; but
                that's a low priority.

            <h1>6/26/23</h1>
            <p>Worked on the personal website assignment today. Messing around wth flex boxes a little more, but
                haven't
                quite gotten the hang of them yet.</p>
            <p>Worked on a couple of <i>Black Star</i> items.
            <p>Bcomnes helped out with <a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">deploy-to-neocities</a>,
                and I was able to get the "exit code 254" error in order to encounter a brand-new error:
                <samp>JSONHTTPERROR: Forbidden</samp>. I'm pretty certain that I'm not making a mistake with the API
                key, and that the tool is no longer looking for errant JS code that isn't there to be found, so I'm
                not
                sure what's going on there.
            </p>
            <p><b>Update:</b> Bcomnes said that there was probably just a problem with the API token. Lo and behold,
                regenerating the API token a couple times worked.

            <h1>6/23/23</h1>
            <p>Worked on <a href="https://github.com/bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities">deploy-to-neocities</a> today,
                which
                required me to get into Github Actions for the first time. In the fourth stage, "Install deps and
                build," I encountered a series of npm errors, ending with <samp>Error: Process completed with exit
                    code
                    254</samp>. I posted about it in the discussion thread but I'll also do some digging on my end
                this
                weekend.

            <h1>6/22/23</h1>
            <p>Started work on a project called <i>Black Star</i> today.</p>
            <p>Current problems include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sizing the sun correctly. A square might not be so bad but I'd like to actively choose to go
                    with a
                    square and not just fall back to it.</li>
                <li>The colors on Andrew Ib and its satellite are wrong. Gotta figure out why.</li>
                <li><del>There are spaces in the red bar where spaces ought not to be. I probably messed up the
                        grid.</del> <small>[6/26/23]</small></li>
                <li><del>Deal with the whitespace on the margins... (much easier if I go with the square alone, but
                        see
                        above)</del> <small>[6/26/23]</small></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><small>[Update 6/26/23]</small> Incomplete fix, needs further work.
                </ul>

            </ul>
            <p>Other things to do before it's complete:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Getting the spacing right between the Andrew object cluster.</li>
                <li>Getting the spacing right between object clusters(near-last task).</li>
                <li>The black and white strips of binary.</li>
                <li>The unblue square.</li>
                <li>Another object cluster (klemperer rosette with orbit trails?) or two.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This is mostly a CSS thing, so I shouldn't spend too much time on it. Ideally, one item every week or
                two, and only if I'm making good progress on other stuff.</p>
            <p>Another thing that I'd like to do, maybe later this week, is work on hooking up Neocities to Github.
                If
                you can read this, then I got around to doing that.
