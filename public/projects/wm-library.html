            <h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Anatomy of a Review</strong></h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Reviews are organized</strong> first by
                author, then by year of publication, and lastly by name. I will admit that this
                is more than a little idiosyncratic.&nbsp;Following this is a link, the word
                count, a rating out of five stars, a sentence-length premise, and, finally an
                archival link to the story via the Wayback Machine. || Following the double
                vertical bars is a capsule review of no more than one hundred words (or two
                hundred and fifty, in the case of novels). || If I have additional thoughts,
                whether directly related or only tangetial to the story, then I'll post a link
                after another pair of vertical bars.&nbsp;<strong>Tags:&nbsp;</strong><em>I'll
                    admit that these don't function like conventional tags</em>,<em> but I hope to
                    have a lot of stories on this page someday</em>,<em> and the the tags will help
                    you sift through them</em>,<em> if you use CTRL+F</em>.</p>

                    href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/23793349">AO3</a>. 4,300 words. ★★★☆☆
                Sword duel in the Late Bronze Age Mediterranean, with mild post-apocalyptic
                themes owing to the recent Bronze Age Collapse. Wayback <a
                    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210125191716/https://archiveofourown.org/works/23793349">here</a>.
                ||&nbsp;Writing is fine but unpolished. Duel is passable, and a good
                illustration of the importance of stakes in combat scenes, but could stand
                revision. Meeting between main characters worthwhile. Motif of silence could
                have elevated story to four stars &mdash; it is almost very good &mdash; but
                feels haphazard; &ldquo;silence speaks&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t speak to me. The
                story describes <i>hekwetai</i> as though they&rsquo;re a mystery to be
                unveiled, which never pays off; maybe assumes the reader already knows what
                <i>hekwetai </i>are (palace agents who operate abroad, generally as traders). ||

                    Dreaming</i>. <a href="https://archive.org/details/manliesdreaming0000tidh_q5g4">Internet
                    Archive</a>. ★★★☆☆ 261 pages (pb). It is Britain, 1939, and the former demagogue
                Adolf Hitler is nothing more than a political refugee and private eye; and in
                another time and place a man lies dreaming, of a world where Germany fell to
                Communism in 1933. ||&nbsp;The book&rsquo;s primary narrator is Hitler, and I
                hate this, and probably that was intentional, and yet I cannot overstate just
                how much I hate this. Excellent work of noir crime fiction, checks all the
                boxes, and not far off from OKD&rsquo;s &ldquo;Man in the High Castle.&rdquo;
                Characters less flat than they are archetypal, though one &mdash; the
                &ldquo;watcher in the dark&rdquo; &mdash; is rather a letdown after all the
                build-up, and of course Adolf Hitler, P.I. stretches the imagination, though
                peculiar enough to suspend disbelief. Well-flavored prose, befitting noir. This
                alternate London is believable, well-detailed. But all this is hobbled by having
                to spend ninety-percent of my time with Adolf Hitler; I preferred even
                &ldquo;Planet Auschwitz,&rdquo; as one of the prisoners calls it. The brief camp
                scenes were dreadful, but at least their viewpoint character wasn&rsquo;t
                literally Hitler. My reaction would doubtless be different if we viewed him only
                from the outside, lacking a front-row seat to every noxious thought that crosses
                his mind. The single bright spot is an unexpected, and unexpectedly touching,
                encounter with Leni Reifenstahl, former Nazi actress and present Hollywood
                starlet, who is perhaps the one person genuinely happy to see him, and with no
                ulterior motive.&nbsp;|| <b>Tags:</b> alternate history (1930s), detective,
