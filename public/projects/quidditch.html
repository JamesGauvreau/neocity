        // Each player can be bad, good, or superb. 
        // Beaters can focus on chasers or focus on the seeker.

        // Seeker can focus on catching the Snitch or focus on interfering with the other Seeker.

        // Seeker rolls d20, success on 16+, if both Seekers roll success then higher number wins, nobody wins on a tie.
            // If seeker interferes with other seeker, then the opposed seeker gets a level of disadvantage and, if the interferer rolls higher than the opposed seeker, then the opposed seeker doesn't win even on succ.
        // Beaters give a level of disadvantage to whichever side they're focusing on.
        // Chasers contribute 1d4, 1d6, or 1d8 to their pool, for 3d4 to 3d8 total.
        // Keepers deduct 1d8, 1d10, or 1d12 points.
