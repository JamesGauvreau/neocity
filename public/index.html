    <p>I'm not sure that this page will ever look fancy. Right now, it mostly exists as a place to host a Twine fic
      without (a) dropping a direct link on AO3 to my commercial Itch.io page or (b) making an entirely new Itch.io
      account for one game.

    <p>You can find my AO3 profile <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/Callmesalticidae/profile">here</a>, or
      find
      out more about my fiction (original and otherwise) <a
        href="https://wmbsaltworks.neocities.org/fiction.html">here</a>.

    <p>Projects hosted on this site:

      <li><a href="/fiction/all_roads.html">All Roads Lead to Rome</a>, a Twine adaptation of the Harry Potter oneshot
        by

        <h2>Policy on Derivative Work</h2>

        <p>You don't need to ask my permission for anything. I'm preemptively giving you my permission, if you really
          want
          it, but I don't believe that I have a right to deny permission in the first place. I will appreciate it if you
          let me know what you're doing with it, but that's a courtesy, not a requirement.

        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I mostly write Harry Potter and Homestuck fanfiction, but got my start on a long Avatar: The Last Airbender
          story that petered out around a quarter of the way through (I don't recommend looking for it, but there's at
          least one FFN collection with a copy on the Internet Archive). I also write original fiction and a variety of
          worldbuilding and writing resources.

        <p>My current Harry Potter project is <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368">There is Nothing to
            Fear</a>, a Gryffindor!Voldemort AU. In Homestuck, it's <a
            href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/202529">The Gods Have Horns</a>, an AU where the beta trolls won
          Sgrub and entered the newly-created universe as gods.

        <p>In all my work, I've been assisted to one degree or another by my beta reader and writing partner, Shadow
          Wasserson.

        <p>Outside fandom, I have a master's degree in Philosophy, and by day I'm a freelance editor and remote tutor. I
          grew up in Michigan and Missouri (in the United States) and have also spent significant time in California,
          Idaho, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.

        <p>You can send me an email at <a href="mailto: callmesalticidae@gmail.com">callmesalticidae@gmail.com</a>, or
          contact me through one of the websites linked above.
