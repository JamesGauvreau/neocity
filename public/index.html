    <h1>WMB Saltworks</h1>

    <p>I'm not sure that this page will ever look fancy. Right now, it mostly exists as a place to host a Twine fic
      without (a) dropping a direct link on AO3 to my commercial Itch.io page or (b) making an entirely new Itch.io
      account for one game.</p>

    <p>You can find my AO3 profile <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/users/Callmesalticidae/profile" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, or
      find
      out more about my fiction (original and otherwise) <a
        href="https://wmbsaltworks.neocities.org/fiction.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>Projects hosted on this site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/fiction/all_roads.html">All Roads Lead to Rome</a>, a Twine adaptation of the Harry Potter oneshot
        by
        Alemantele.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Policy on Derivative Work</h2>

    <p>You don't need to ask my permission for anything. I'm preemptively giving you my permission, if you really
      want it, but I don't believe that I have a right to deny permission in the first place. I will appreciate it if
      you
      let me know what you're doing with it, but that's a courtesy, not a requirement.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>I mostly write Harry Potter and Homestuck fanfiction, but got my start on a long Avatar: The Last Airbender
      story that petered out around a quarter of the way through (I don't recommend looking for it, but there's at
      least one FFN collection with a copy on the Internet Archive). I also write original fiction and a variety of
      worldbuilding and writing resources.</p>

    <p>My current Harry Potter project is <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/1087368" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">There is Nothing to
        Fear</a>, a Gryffindor!Voldemort AU. In Homestuck, it's <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/series/202529"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The
        Gods Have Horns</a>, an AU where the beta trolls won
      Sgrub and entered the newly-created universe as gods.</p>

    <p>In all my work, I've been assisted to one degree or another by my beta reader and writing partner, Shadow
      Wasserson.</p>

    <p>Outside fandom, I have a master's degree in Philosophy, and by day I'm a freelance editor and remote tutor. I
      grew up in Michigan and Missouri (in the United States) and have also spent significant time in California,
      Idaho, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.</p>
