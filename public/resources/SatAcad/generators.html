    <h1>Food</h1>
    <h2>Rations</h2>
    <p>The typical student meal is a dense, cheese-like "minceloaf" (ground fat, fruit, and protein) wrapped in two layers of thin flatbread. May also be referred to as hash or mash, or a bar or a cake. Mince is traditionally stored in a stomach or intestines, and "sausaged mince" (aka mincepipe, mincetube) is sometimes eaten.</p>
    <p>Minceloaves can be eaten raw or mixed with water (in which it may dissolve well) to create a stew (which may resemble <a href="https://coolantarctica.com/schools/IMGP7161-sm.jpg">this</a>, and have a "chunky peanut butter" texture if the solids are insufficiently powderized), and the bread can serve as a plate, wrapping, or utensil. By cooking the mincebar in its bread, you can also create a kind of pie.</p>
